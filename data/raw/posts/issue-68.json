In the 1990s, the internet was embraced successfully by incumbent companies including Apple and Microsoft, but it also inspired hugely impactful startups like Amazon, Facebook, and Google. Similarly, AI now is empowering forward-looking incumbent companies — many of them former internet startups — and creating massive opportunities for new startups as well.</em></p><p><em>I’ve been thinking about what I can do to help members of the DeepLearning.AI community who wish to create a company.

A new method addresses the issue by training a feature extractor on both X-rays and text that accompanies them.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Yuhao Zhang and colleagues at Stanford University proposed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00747?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ConVIRT</a>, a method that uses contrastive learning to learn from unlabeled images paired with corresponding text reports.

ConVIRT generates features based on similarities between images and corresponding reports, as well as differences between images and unrelated reports.<br><br><strong>How it works: </strong>The authors built separate pipelines for images and text. The image pipeline consisted of a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ResNet-50</a>, followed by a neural network with a single hidden layer (to project the image vectors into a consistent space for comparison with the text vectors}.

The text pipeline learned in a similar way.</li><li>They extracted the ResNet-50 model and fine-tuned it for four image classification tasks, including the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge</a> of diagnosing pneumonia in chest X-rays.M</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> In all four tasks, ConVIRT outperformed baseline models including a ResNet-50 pretrained on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ImageNet</a> and fine-tuned on RSNA and other datasets, and custom models built to generate the paired text from an image. Fine-tuned on 1 percent of the RSNA dataset, ConVIRT achieved 88.8 AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, higher is better), compared to the ImageNet model (83.1 AUC) and the best custom image-text model (87.7 AUC). Fine-tuned on 10 percent of RSNA, ConVIRT outperformed those models 91.5 AUC to 87.3 AUC and 89.9 AUC respectively.<br><br><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Pretraining on paired images and text via contrastive learning could help alleviate the high cost of medical data for deep learning.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>For updates on leading-edge AI for medicine, check out the new <a href=\"https://theaihealthpodcast.com/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">AI Health Podcast</a> cohosted by Pranav Rajpurkar, instructor of our <em><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">AI For Medicine Specialization</a></em>.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Gif203.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Gif 3\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>We’re excited to announce that “Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow,” Course 3 of the <em>TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization</em>, will launch on December 9th. <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-computer-vision-with-tensorflow?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Pre-enroll now</a></p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-gif-maker2040.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Examples of Xpression app working (people in pajamas looking like they're wearing suits)\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"gan-makes-pajamas-safe-for-work\">GAN Makes Pajamas Safe For Work</h3><p>A new camera app uses a generative adversarial network to let users look like they’re dressed for success while they videoconference in their jammies.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/xpression-camera-a-virtual-camera-app-that-reinvents-zoom-calls-amid-the-coronavirus-pandemic-301169902.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Xpression</a> is an iPhone app that maps facial expressions onto still images in real time, allowing users to stream live video selfies clothed in digital costumes.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The app uses three deep learning models, a spokesperson for app maker <a href=\"https://embodyme.com/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">EmbodyMe</a> told <em>The Batch</em>.</p><ul><li>The first model estimates three-dimensional face shapes and expressions from the source video.
