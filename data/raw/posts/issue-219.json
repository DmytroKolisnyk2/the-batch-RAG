I’ll go out on a limb to make another prediction: I think we’ll see significant growth in AI, including Generative AI, applications running at the edge of the network (PC, laptop, mobile, and so on).&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>I realize this flies in the face of conventional wisdom. Most AI runs in data centers, not on edge devices. There are good reasons for this:</em></p><ul><li><em>The most powerful large language models require 100B+ parameters and massive amounts of memory even for inference (100B parameters, stored using 8- bit quantization, requires 100GB of memory).</em></li><li><em>Many businesses prefer to operate cloud-based, software-as-a-service (SaaS) products (which allows them to charge a recurring subscription fee) rather than software running at the edge (where customers tend to prefer paying a one-time fee). SaaS also gives the company access to data to improve the product and makes the product easier to upgrade.</em></li><li><em>Many developers today have been trained to build SaaS applications, and want to build cloud-hosted applications rather than desktop or other edge applications.</em></li></ul><p><em>Here’s why I think those factors won’t stop AI’s growth at the edge.&nbsp;</em></p><ul><li><em>AI applications are starting to run quite well on modern edge devices. For example, I regularly run models with around 1B to 10B parameters on my laptop. If I’m working on an airplane without WiFi access, I will occasionally run a small model to help me with my work.</em></li><li><em>For many applications, a model of modest size works fine, especially if it’s fine-tuned to the task at hand. To help me find grammatical errors in my writing, do I really need a 175B parameter model that has broad knowledge of philosophy, history, astronomy, and every other topic under the sun?</em></li><li><em>Many users, especially those from Gen Z (born around 1996 to 2010), whose behavior tends to be a leading indicator of future consumer trends, are increasingly sensitive to privacy. This has been a boon to Apple’s product sales, given the company’s reputation for privacy. Surely, to check my grammar, I don’t need to share my data with a big tech company?&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Similarly, for corporations worried about their own data privacy, edge computing (as well as on-premises and virtual private cloud options) could be appealing.</em></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/10/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--20--1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Left: Datacenter Right: Human hands holding and manipulating a mobile phone\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--20--1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--20--1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/10/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--20--1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Further, strong commercial interests are propelling AI to the edge. Chip makers like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel sell chips to data centers (where sales have grown rapidly) and for use in PCs and laptops (where sales have plummeted since the pandemic). Thus, semiconductor manufacturers as well as PC/laptop makers (and Microsoft, whose sales of the Windows operating system depend on sales of new PC/laptops) are highly motivated to encourage adoption of edge AI, since this would likely require consumers to upgrade their devices to have the more modern AI accelerators.&nbsp;So many companies stand to benefit from the rise of edge AI and will have an incentive to promote it.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>AI Fund has been exploring a variety of edge AI applications, and I think the opportunities will be rich and varied. Interesting semiconductor technology will support them. For example, AMD’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/solutions/ai.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90rGB3yM9BNW-WXLvbhGGf8NIouu7ehIo-z12ju_TCVJNYfoOMO-RzCDtJYHxJnbdlQ-qe\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>xDNA</em></a>&nbsp;architecture, drawing on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.xilinx.com/products/technology/ai-engine.html]?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90rGB3yM9BNW-WXLvbhGGf8NIouu7ehIo-z12ju_TCVJNYfoOMO-RzCDtJYHxJnbdlQ-qe\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>configurable cores</em></a>&nbsp;designed by Xilinx (now an AMD company), is making it easier to run multiple AI models simultaneously. This enables a future in which one AI model adjusts image quality on our video call, another checks our grammar in real time, and a third pulls up relevant articles. &nbsp;</em></p><p><em>While it’s still early days for edge AI — in both consumer and industrial markets (for example, running in factories or on heavy machinery) — I think it’s worth investigating, in addition to the numerous opportunities in cloud-hosted AI applications. &nbsp;<br><br>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p>&nbsp;<em>P.S.

It worked accurately and quickly enough to enable doctors to adjust their approach in the operating room.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;Brain surgeons don’t know the type of tumor they will remove until an operation is underway. When they have a sample — about the size of a kernel of corn — they can classify it by looking at it under a microscope. Alternatively, they can send it out for DNA sequencing, which can take weeks, requiring a second surgery. However, faster, less precise DNA sequencing can be performed on-site, and a neural network can classify such preliminary DNA sequences quickly and accurately. This way, a doctor can proceed with the operation with confidence in the tumor’s classification.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors trained a system of four vanilla neural networks to classify brain tumors.</p><ul><li>The authors made a labeled dataset of nearly 17 million artificial DNA sequences of around 90 tumor types, each constructed by assembling random parts from one of 2,800&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26000?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90rGB3yM9BNW-WXLvbhGGf8NIouu7ehIo-z12ju_TCVJNYfoOMO-RzCDtJYHxJnbdlQ-qe\" rel=\"noopener\">sequences</a>&nbsp;of tumor and non-tumor DNA. This approach simulated the messy nature of the fast DNA sequencing process.</li><li>For each neural network, they randomly selected half the sequences for training and used the other half for testing and validation. They trained the networks to classify the tumor types.</li><li>At inference, all four models classified each DNA sample. The system selected the classification from the model that had the highest confidence above a certain threshold. Samples that didn’t clear the confidence threshold received no classification.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors’ system performed well on tumor DNA samples in an existing collection as well as those gathered in an operating room. Tested on samples from 415 tumors, it classified 60.7 percent of them accurately, misclassified 1.9 percent, and was unable to classify 37.3 percent. Tested on samples collected during 25 real surgeries, it correctly classified 18 tumors and was unable to classify 7. In all cases, it returned results within 90 minutes (45 minutes to collect the DNA and 45 minutes to analyze it).</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;90 minutes is fast enough to inform brain surgeons what kind of tumor they’re dealing with in the early phase of an operation. If this technique can be rolled out widely, it may help save many lives.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Inferencing presumably takes seconds. The authors say the quick sequencing method processes DNA in 20 to 40 minutes. Speeding up that step offers great potential to accelerate the process.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-for-everyone?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/10/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--70-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Generative AI for Everyone course promotional banner\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--70-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--70-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--70-.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/10/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--70-.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>“Generative AI for Everyone,” taught by Andrew Ng, is coming soon!

A new approach to this sort of prompting improved ChatGPT’s accuracy on a variety of reasoning problems.</p><p><strong>What's new:&nbsp;</strong>Jiashuo Sun and colleagues at Xiamen University, Microsoft, and IDEA Research, introduced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11657?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90rGB3yM9BNW-WXLvbhGGf8NIouu7ehIo-z12ju_TCVJNYfoOMO-RzCDtJYHxJnbdlQ-qe\" rel=\"noopener\">iterative bootstrapping in chain-of-thought-prompting</a>, a method that prompts a large language model to generate correct chains of thought for difficult problems, so it can use them as guides to solving other problems.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;Researchers have developed a few ways to prompt a large language model to apply a chain of thought (CoT). The typical method is for a human to write an example CoT for inclusion in a prompt. A faster way is to skip the hand-crafted example and simply instruct the model to “think step by step,” prompting it to generate not only a solution but its own CoT (this is called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90rGB3yM9BNW-WXLvbhGGf8NIouu7ehIo-z12ju_TCVJNYfoOMO-RzCDtJYHxJnbdlQ-qe\" rel=\"noopener\">zero-shot CoT)</a>. To improve zero-shot CoT, other work both (i) asked a model to “think step by step” and (ii) provided generated CoTs (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03493?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90rGB3yM9BNW-WXLvbhGGf8NIouu7ehIo-z12ju_TCVJNYfoOMO-RzCDtJYHxJnbdlQ-qe\" rel=\"noopener\">auto-CoT</a>). The weakness of this approach is that the model can generate fallacious CoTs and rely on them when responding to the prompt at hand, which can lead to incorrect responses. To solve this problem, we can draw example prompts from a dataset that includes correct responses, and the model can check its responses against the dataset labels. If it’s wrong, it can try repeatedly until it answers correctly. In this way, it generates correct CoT examples to use in solving other problems.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;To prompt ChatGPT to reason effectively, the authors built a database of example problems, chains of thought, and solutions. They drew problems from 11 datasets: six arithmetic reasoning datasets (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14168?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90rGB3yM9BNW-WXLvbhGGf8NIouu7ehIo-z12ju_TCVJNYfoOMO-RzCDtJYHxJnbdlQ-qe\" rel=\"noopener\">grade-school math word problems</a>), four common-sense reasoning datasets (for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00370/100680/Did-Aristotle-Use-a-Laptop-A-Question-Answering?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90rGB3yM9BNW-WXLvbhGGf8NIouu7ehIo-z12ju_TCVJNYfoOMO-RzCDtJYHxJnbdlQ-qe\" rel=\"noopener\">questions like “Did Aristotle use a laptop?”</a>), and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90rGB3yM9BNW-WXLvbhGGf8NIouu7ehIo-z12ju_TCVJNYfoOMO-RzCDtJYHxJnbdlQ-qe\" rel=\"noopener\">symbolic reasoning dataset</a>&nbsp;consisting of tasks that involved manipulating letters in words (for instance, “Take the last letters of the words in ‘Steve Sweeney’ and concatenate them”).</p><ul><li>The authors prompted the model with a problem and instructed it to “think step by step” as it generated a solution, and they recorded the input and output.&nbsp;</li><li>When the model’s solution did not match the solution in the dataset, the authors instructed the model to try again using prompts such as, “The answer is not right, can you think more carefully and give me the final answer?” They repeated this step until the model delivered the correct solution.</li><li>Once the model had solved a problem correctly, they prompted it to present the answer again along with the steps that led to it. This output generally rendered the chain of thought more concisely than the model’s initial correct responses. They stored the problem, chain of thought, and solution in a database.</li><li>At inference, when prompting the model to solve a problem, the authors included in the prompt four to eight database entries selected at random.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors evaluated their method versus hand-crafting and auto-CoT. Of the 11 datasets, their method achieved the best results on 8. For example, on grade-school math word problems, ChatGPT prompted using their method achieved 73.6 percent accuracy; using hand-crafted prompts, it achieved 69.3 percent accuracy, and using auto-CoT, it achieved 71.4 percent accuracy. Their method underperformed hand-crafted prompts on two common-sense reasoning datasets (76.8 percent versus 77.1 percent and 69.3 percent versus 71.1 percent). It underperformed auto-CoT on one arithmetic dataset (91.9 percent versus 92.5 percent.)</p><p><strong>Why it matters:&nbsp;</strong>Large language models have powerful latent capabilities that can be activated by clever prompting. ChatGPT was able to solve the problems in the authors’ database, but only after multiple tries. Prompting it with examples of its own correct solutions to these problems apparently enabled it to solve other, similarly difficult problems without needing multiple tries.</p><p><strong>We're thinking:</strong>&nbsp;It may be possible to modify this method to make human input unnecessary by asking the model to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90rGB3yM9BNW-WXLvbhGGf8NIouu7ehIo-z12ju_TCVJNYfoOMO-RzCDtJYHxJnbdlQ-qe\" rel=\"noopener\">fix the problems in its previous generations</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11738?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90rGB3yM9BNW-WXLvbhGGf8NIouu7ehIo-z12ju_TCVJNYfoOMO-RzCDtJYHxJnbdlQ-qe\" rel=\"noopener\">use external tools to validate its outputs</a>.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong>Baidu announces Ernie 4.0</strong><br>The Chinese tech giant demonstrated a new version of its generative AI model at an event on Tuesday.
