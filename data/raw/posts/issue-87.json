Rather than designing a grand system, spending months to build it, and then launching it and hoping for the best, it’s usually better to build a quick-and-dirty system, get feedback, and use that feedback to improve the system.</em><br><br><em>The iterative aspect of machine learning applies to many steps. For example:</em><br><br><em><strong>Data labeling: </strong>It’s hard to come up with fully fleshed-out labeling guidelines that result in clean and consistent labels on your first attempt. It might be better to use an initial set of guidelines to label some data, see what problems arise, and then improve the guidelines.</em><br><br><em><strong>Model training:</strong> Building an AI system requires deciding what data, hyperparameters, and model architecture to use. Rather than overthinking these choices, it’s often better to train an initial model, then use error analysis to drive improvements.</em><br><br><em><strong>Deployment and monitoring: </strong>When deploying a machine learning system, you might implement dashboards that track various metrics to try to spot concept drift or data drift. For example, if you’re building a product recommendation system, you might track both software metrics such as queries per second and statistical metrics such as how often the system recommends products of different categories. What metrics should we track? Rather than try to design the perfect set of dashboards before launch, I find it more fruitful to pick a very large set of metrics, evolve them, and prune the ones that prove less useful.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/5871640/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-04-14%20at%2010.46.44%20AM%20copy.png?upscale=true&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-04-14%20at%2010.46.44%20AM%20copy.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Lifecycle of an ML project\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><em>Iteration is helpful in other phases of machine learning development as well.

On average, 3.4 percent of examples in 10 commonly used datasets are mislabeled, according to a new <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14749?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9f7YHNd8qpt5LHT3IGlrOl7XfGH4Jj7ufDaRBkKoodIWAvZIq_nHMP98dJLTiwlC4FVcwq\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> — and the detrimental impact of such errors rises with model size.</p><p><strong>The research:</strong> Curtis Northcutt and Anish Athalye at MIT and Jonas Mueller at Amazon trained a model to identify erroneous labels in popular datasets such as ImageNet, Amazon Reviews, and IMDB.</p><ul><li>Following <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9f7YHNd8qpt5LHT3IGlrOl7XfGH4Jj7ufDaRBkKoodIWAvZIq_nHMP98dJLTiwlC4FVcwq\" rel=\"noopener\">confident learning</a>, the authors considered an example mislabeled if it met two conditions: The model’s predicted classification didn't match the label, and the model’s confidence in its classification was greater than its average confidence in its predictions of the labeled class over all examples bearing that label.</li><li>Human reviewers vetted the mislabeled examples. They found many obvious mistakes: an image of a frog labeled “cat,” an audio clip of a singer labeled “whistling,” and negative movie reviews misinterpreted as positive. QuickDraw had the highest rate of inaccurately labeled data, 10.1 percent. MNIST had the lowest, 0.15 percent.</li><li>The authors fixed the bad labels and revised the test sets. Then they measured how well different models classified the corrected test sets. Smaller models like Resnet-18 or VGG-11 outperformed larger ones like NasNet or VGG-19.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It’s well known that machine learning datasets contain a fair percentage of errors. Previous inquiries into the problem focused on training rather than test sets, and found that training on a small percentage of incorrect labels didn’t hurt deep learning performance. But accuracy on a test set that’s rife with errors is not a true measure of a model’s ability, and bad labels in the test set have a disproportionate impact on bigger models.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> It’s time for our community to shift from model-centric to data-centric AI development. Many state-of-the-art models work well enough that tinkering with their architecture yields little gain in many problems, and the most direct path to improved performance is to systematically improve the data your algorithm learns from.

A new GAN achieved a similar end using transformers in their original form.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Yifan Jiang and collaborators at the University of Texas at Austin and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab unveiled <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07074?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9f7YHNd8qpt5LHT3IGlrOl7XfGH4Jj7ufDaRBkKoodIWAvZIq_nHMP98dJLTiwlC4FVcwq\">TransGAN</a>, a transformer-based GAN that doesn’t use any convolutions.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Traditionally, GANs rely on convolutional neural networks, which integrate information in pixels far away from one another only in the later layers. The upshot could be an image of a person with two different eye colors or mismatched earrings. A GAN based on transformers, which use self-attention to determine relationships among various parts of an input, would learn relationships between pixels across an entire image from the get-go. That should enable it to produce more realistic images.</p><p><strong>How it works</strong>: Like other GANs, TransGAN includes a generator (which, given a random input, generates a new image) and a discriminator (which, given an image, predicts whether or not it’s generated). Both components contain a sequence of transformer layers, each comprising a fully connected layer and a self-attention layer. The authors trained them simultaneously.</p><ul><li>Where a typical GAN’s generator uses convolutions to manipulate a two-dimensional representation, TransGAN uses transformers to manipulate a sequence and project it into a sequence of pixels. To cut the amount of computation required, the generator produces a small number of representations at the first layer and increases the number in subsequent layers.</li><li>Convolutions typically focus on small, adjacent areas of an input to avoid unnaturally abrupt transitions. To encode similar smoothness without convolutions, TransGAN’s generator applied a mask during training that limited attention to neighboring parts of an image. The mask gradually enlarged until it covered the entire image.</li><li>The discriminator receives an image divided into an 8x8 grid, which it converts into a sequence of 64 patches. The sequence passes through the transformer layers, ending with a linear layer that classifies the image.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> TransGAN set a new state of the art on the <a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9f7YHNd8qpt5LHT3IGlrOl7XfGH4Jj7ufDaRBkKoodIWAvZIq_nHMP98dJLTiwlC4FVcwq\">STL-10</a> dataset, which includes relatively few labeled examples and many unlabeled examples in a similar distribution.

A new system learned from unlabeled data to transfer such motions from one character to another.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Cinjon Resnick at New York University and colleagues at Nvidia, Technical University of Berlin, and Google developed a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00863?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9f7YHNd8qpt5LHT3IGlrOl7XfGH4Jj7ufDaRBkKoodIWAvZIq_nHMP98dJLTiwlC4FVcwq\">system</a> designed to isolate changes in the pose of a two-dimensional figure, or sprite, and apply them to another sprite. While earlier approaches to solving this problem require labeled data, the new system is self-supervised.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> A 2D animation consists of three elements: a sprite, the sprite’s motion and any special effects, and a background (which remains static in this work). Separate neural networks optimizing a variety of loss terms can learn to disentangle these elements, compute their changes from frame to frame, and recombine them to produce a novel frame.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The system comprises four convolutional neural networks: two encoders, a transformation network, and a decoder. It generates a new frame given an image of a target sprite, a background, and two frames of animation showing a source sprite in motion — say, the initial frame and the one showing the pose, position, or other attributes to be mapped onto the target. During training, the images of the target sprite, background, and first frame of the animation were identical. The training and test sets consisted of <a href=\"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2015/hash/e07413354875be01a996dc560274708e-Abstract.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9f7YHNd8qpt5LHT3IGlrOl7XfGH4Jj7ufDaRBkKoodIWAvZIq_nHMP98dJLTiwlC4FVcwq\">several hundred animated video game characters performing various motions</a>.</p><ul><li>One encoder generated a representation of the background based on the background reference image. The other generated separate representations of the target sprite and two animation frames.</li><li>The transformation network used the representations of the two animation frames to generate a matrix describing how the sprite changed. The authors combined the various representations by multiplying the matrix by the target sprite’s representation and adding the background representation.</li><li>The decoder used the result to produce an image of the target sprite, against the background, in the source sprite’s position in the second animation frame.</li><li>The authors trained these components at once using a loss function consisting of three terms. The first term encouraged the background representation to remain constant from frame to frame. The second encouraged the transformed representation of the target sprite — that is, the transformation network’s matrix multiplied by the initial target sprite representation — to be similar to that of the source sprite in the second animation frame. The third minimized the pixel difference between the generated image and the second animation frame.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors compared their system with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02586?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9f7YHNd8qpt5LHT3IGlrOl7XfGH4Jj7ufDaRBkKoodIWAvZIq_nHMP98dJLTiwlC4FVcwq\">Visual Dynamics</a>. It underperformed the competition, achieving a mean squared error of ~20 versus ~16 — but Visual Dynamics is a supervised system that requires labeled training data.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> A collection of networks that study different aspects of a dataset, and then compare and combine the representations they generate, can yield valuable information when labels aren’t available.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Possibly a useful tool for animators.
