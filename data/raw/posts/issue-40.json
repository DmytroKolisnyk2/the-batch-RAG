This sort of learning typically involves complicated techniques, but researchers achieved state-of-the-art results using a simpler approach.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> An MIT-Google collaboration led by Yonglong Tian and Yue Wang discovered that simple classifiers with access to an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11539v1?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">embedding that represents similar tasks</a> can outperform the best few-shot techniques.</p><p><strong>Few-shot learning:</strong> A typical few-shot learning algorithm might receive, for example, 100 different supervised learning tasks with a small training set per task. One task could be recognizing dogs based on, say, 600 images of dogs. Another might be recognizing buses based on a similar number of examples. By drawing on commonalities among the 100 tasks, the algorithm aims to do well on a 101st task using a similarly limited training set.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Previous methods for extracting commonalities from a set of training tasks were complex. The authors found that simply training a shared feature extractor on a number of tasks, with few training examples of each, allowed a rudimentary algorithm to learn to perform well on novel tasks, also with few training examples.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers used conventional supervised learning to train a network to classify images that represent 100 different classes, using 600 images of each class. Simple classifiers for each task had the same architecture and parameters up to the final hidden layer.</p><ul><li>After training, the network’s output layer was removed and the final hidden layer was used as a feature extractor.</li><li>A logistic regression model used features from the extractor to learn from a small number of examples of a novel class.</li><li>The researchers improved the system’s accuracy via knowledge distillation; that is, using an existing model to train a new one. The first feature extractor’s output fed a second, and the second learned to recreate the first’s output. They performed this operation repeatedly.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers tested their method against state-of-the-art <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03758.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">few-shot</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.02729.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">models</a> on four datasets derived from ImageNet or CIFAR10. Their method gained around 3 percentage points of accuracy, averaging around 79 percent.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This work aligns few-shot learning more closely than earlier methods with supervised learning and multi-task learning. The use of common techniques throughout machine learning could spur more rapid progress than specialized approaches.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Many potential applications of deep learning hinge on models that can learn from small data. We’re glad to have a simple approach to the problem.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Moonshot2.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Colorful chemical fragments bind to the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"crowdsourcing-a-cure\">Crowdsourcing a Cure</h3><p>Researchers are drawing up blueprints for drugs to fight Covid-19.

Conveniently, natural language models can read medical records to extract labels for X-ray images.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> A Stanford team including Akshay Smit and Saahil Jain developed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09167?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">CheXbert</a>, a network that labels chest X-rays nearly as accurately as human radiologists. (Disclosure: The authors include Pranav Rajpurkar, teacher of deeplearning.ai’s <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">AI for Medicine Specialization</a>, as well as Andrew Ng.)<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> A natural language model trained on a rule-based system can generalize to situations the rule-based system doesn’t recognize. This is not a new insight, but it is novel in the authors’ application.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> CheXbert predicts a label from 14 diagnostic classes in the similarly named <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07031?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">CheXpert</a> dataset: one of 12 conditions, uncertain, or blank.

The researchers used a Facebook <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06616?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">translator</a> to turn the reports from English into German and back, producing rephrased versions.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> CheXbert achieved an F1 score of 0.798 on the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07042?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">MIMIC-CXR</a> dataset of chest X-rays. That’s 0.045 better than CheXpert’s labeler and 0.007 short of a board-certified radiologist’s score.<br><br><strong>Yes, but: </strong>This approach requires a pre-existing, high-quality labeler. Moreover, the neural network’s gain over the rule-based system comes at the cost of interpretability.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> A doctor’s attention is too valuable to spend relabeling hundreds of thousands of patient records as one-hot vectors for every possible medical condition. Rule-based labeling can automate some of the work, but language models are better at determining labels.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Deep learning is poised to accomplish great things in medicine.

Some of the spurious posts are illustrated above.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Building a classifier to spot coronavirus disinformation is hard because, as information about the disease evolves, so does the disinformation. Facebook relies on people from 60-plus partner organizations to flag misleading posts and ads, such as false claims that drinking bleach cures the virus, social distancing doesn’t help prevent its spread, and dark-skinned people are especially resistant.
