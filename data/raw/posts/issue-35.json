He believes the technology can not only liberate physicians from the growing burden of clerical work, but also synthesize layers of patient data — behavioral, genomic, microbiomic, and so on — into truly personalized healthcare. A cardiologist and geneticist at Scripps Research Institute in Southern California, he is the author of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/40915762-deep-medicine?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\"><em>Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again</em></a>. Below he shares his insights into the fusion of AI and medicine and advice for machine learning engineers who want to get involved.<br><br><strong><em>The Batch</em>: </strong><em>Let’s start with the topic on everyone’s mind: Where do you see AI’s greatest potential in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic?</em><br><br><strong>Topol:</strong> One thing that’s been overlooked is the ability to develop and validate algorithms for at-home monitoring. We don’t want everyone who has Covid-19 symptoms to go to the hospital. On the other hand, some people who catch Covid-19 have sudden demise, and it’s hard to predict. If we could tell who’s safe to monitor at home, that would be great help in managing this epidemic around the world.<br><br><em><strong>The Batch: </strong>You’re concerned with the depersonalization of doctor-patient relationships. How can AI help?</em><br><br><strong>Topol:</strong> Four words: the gift of time. Clinicians spend too much of their time being data clerks. There shouldn’t be any need for a screen and a keyboard to see a patient. Entering notes into the medical record should be done by AI.<br><br><em><strong>The Batch: </strong>Researchers have had experimental success interpreting medical images. Yet these innovations haven’t had much impact on clinical practice. What’s the holdup?</em><br><br><strong>Topol:</strong> The medical community feels threatened that the machines will encroach on their lives. Also, some companies working on things like this have proprietary algorithms and don’t publish their data, so there’s a lack of transparency. They get their FDA clearance based on retrospective studies and use the same data over and over, because there aren’t many large, annotated medical datasets. We need prospective studies based on real-world patients in multiple real-world clinical settings. And we need more randomized trials — there have been only six or seven of those.<br><br><em><strong>The Batch: </strong>If you could collect any data you wanted for everyone in the world, what would it be, and for what AI task?</em><br><br><strong>Topol:</strong> That’s easy: We need a planetary health system. We’d have multilevel data for every person, and each person would teach the rest of their species about preventing and managing illnesses using nearest neighbor analysis and other tools of AI. It’s possible now, but it requires an international commitment. I wrote about this with my colleague Kai-Fu Lee in an article called “<a href=\"https://www.scripps.edu/_files/pdfs/news-and-events/blog/It%20takes%20a%20planet-eric-topol-08022019.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">It Takes a Planet</a>.” <br><br><em><strong>The Batch: </strong>How can we build a planetary health system that protects data privacy and security?</em><br><br><strong>Topol:</strong> The tools are in front of us now. We can use federated and homomorphic computing. No country has to hand their data over. The algorithms can be used at the locale.<br><br><em><strong>The Batch: </strong>Much of the AI community is deeply concerned about making sure the technology is used ethically. What should AI practitioners keep in mind in that regard?</em><br><br><strong>Topol:</strong> Anything that exacerbates the very significant health inequalities that exist today is not acceptable. Human bias that finds its way into algorithms is a significant ethical concern that needs extensive review and scrutiny. And that’s not all. Algorithms in medicine need to be under constant surveillance because if an algorithm is hacked, it could hurt a lot of people.<br><br><em><strong>The Batch: </strong>What advice would you give machine learning engineers who want to make a positive impact in medicine?</em><br><br><strong>Topol:</strong> We’re still in the early phase. We need more interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary efforts between clinicians and AI practitioners. We need more large, annotated datasets, or to use self-supervised learning that preempts the need for them. We need to go to a higher validation plane, however we get there. Then we’ll be able to take advantage of this extraordinary opportunity to transform medicine and return the human essence that has been largely lost.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-diagnosis.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Illustration of doctor seeing a patient\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"diagnosis-the-telltale-heart\">Diagnosis: The Telltale Heart</h2><p>The wearable revolution is helping doctors figure out what’s troubling your ticker — thanks to deep learning.<br><br><strong>The problem:</strong> Arrhythmias, a range of conditions in which the heart beats too fast, too slow, or erratically, can cause <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/why-arrhythmia-matters?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">heart attack or stroke</a>.

The authors noted, however, that the studies tend to suffer from poor controls, inconsistent metrics for measuring success, and lack of independent validation. No comparable assessment of non-image AI diagnostics exists, but the fact that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/healthcare/docs/site/Apple_Watch_Arrhythmia_Detection.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">integrating arrhythmia detection</a> into its smartwatch suggests that the field is maturing.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Arrhythmias occur sporadically enough that spotting them requires many days of data. “You’ll never catch one by running an electrocardiogram in the office,” according to <a href=\"https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/arruda-mauricio-1326151366?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Dr. Mauricio Arruda</a> of Cleveland’s University Hospitals Harrington Heart &amp; Vascular Institute.

This crucial window allows clinicians to intervene.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The system integrates vital signs, test results, and medical histories of emergency-room patients, assessing their risk of septic shock on a scale of 0 to 100 percent. If the risk reaches 60 percent, the system alerts nurses in the hospital’s <a href=\"https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer/rapid-response-systems?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">rapid response team</a>. It also publishes an hourly list of each patient’s septic risk score.</p><ul><li>Researchers from Duke University, Harvard, and Google trained the model on a dataset of 50,000 patient records from the Duke hospital system.</li><li>They evaluated the model at Duke and later expanded to two other community hospitals. All three continue to use it.</li><li>The researchers designed Sepsis Watch with input from the hospital’s rapid response nurses.

Sepsis Watch significantly improved sepsis response times, Sendak told <em>The Batch</em>. The team plans to publish the results in the near future. Last July, Duke University licensed the software to <a href=\"https://cohere-med.com/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Cohere Med</a>, an AI healthcare startup.<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Suchi Saria, a machine learning expert at Johns Hopkins University, was a pioneer in the use of reinforcement learning to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0253-x?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">identify sepsis</a> treatment strategies back in 2018.

The authors’ picks included early-warning systems for cardiac arrest, surgical complications, pneumonia, and kidney disease.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> As little as three hours of warning can give caregivers time to begin tests and medications that dramatically improve a sepsis victim’s odds of survival.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Building a great model is Step 1.
