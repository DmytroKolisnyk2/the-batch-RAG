The volume of messages means that automation is required. But the question of what is appropriate moderation versus inappropriate censorship lingers.</em></p><p><em>AI is helpful for scaling up a moderation policy. But it doesn’t address the core challenge of defining a policy: Which expressions to permit and which to block. This is hard for both humans and AI.</em></p><p><em>Deciding what to block is hard because natural language is ambiguous.</em></p><ul><li><em>“Don’t let them get away with this” could be an incitement to violence or a call for justice.</em></li><li><em>“The vaccine has dangerous side effects” could be a scientific fact or misinformation.</em></li></ul><p><em>The meanings of words vary from person to person. My son says “wawa” when he wants water, and only his close family (and now you!) understand. At work, teams invent acronyms that others don’t understand. More problematically, lawbreakers and hate groups develop code words to discuss their activities.</em></p><p><em>If humans understand the same words differently, how can we train an AI to make such distinctions? If a piece of text has no fixed meaning, then enforcing policies based on the text is difficult. Should we hide it from user A if they would read it as promoting violence, but show it to user B if they would view it as benign? Or should hiding a message be based on the intent of the sender? None of these options is satisfying.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/unnamed--12-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A red Facebook dislike button surrounded by dozens of Facebook like buttons\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/unnamed--12-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/unnamed--12-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/unnamed--12-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Further, getting the data to build an AI system to accomplish any of this is hard. How can the developers who gather the data understand its full range of meanings? Different communities have their own interpretations, making it impossible to keep track.</em></p><p><em>Even if the meaning are unambiguous, making the right decision is still hard. Fortunately, social media platforms can choose from a menu of options depending on how egregious a message is and the degree of confidence that it’s problematic. Choices include showing it to a smaller audience, adding a warning label, and suspending, temporarily or permanently, the user who posted it. Having a range of potential consequences helps social media platforms manage the tradeoff between silencing and protecting users (and society).</em></p><p><em>Despite their flaws, AI systems make social media better. Imagine email without AI-driven spam filtering; it would rapidly become unusable. Similarly, AI is critical for eliminating the most spammy or toxic social media messages. But the challenge of moderating any given message transcends AI.</em></p><p><em>It’s important to acknowledge this challenge openly, so we can debate the principles we would apply to this problem and recognize that there may be no perfect solution. Through transparent and robust debate, I believe that we can build trust around content moderation and make tradeoffs that maximize social media’s benefit.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"deeplearningai-exclusive\">DeepLearning.AI Exclusive</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/how-to-build-a-career-in-ai-book?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/unnamed--11-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Andrew Ng's 'How to Build Your Career in AI' eBook cover\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/unnamed--11-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/unnamed--11-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/unnamed--11-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><h1 id=\"free-ebook-build-your-career-in-ai\"><strong>Free eBook: Build Your Career in AI</strong></h1><p>How do you build an AI resume without job experience?

However, executives realized earlier this year that they couldn’t meet the deadline and decided to scale back the autonomous features. The new timeline calls for a prototype by 2024, testing through 2025, and launch in 2026. The target price is under $100,000, a markdown from the original $120,000. The company is currently testing its semi-autonomous system on Lexus SUVs in several U.S. states.</p><ul><li>The original design called for an interior in which all the seats faced the center, without a steering wheel or pedals.

It wouldn’t need to memorize so much — and thus wouldn’t need so many parameters — if it had access to documents on demand.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> Atlas comprises a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09118?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8k041XCLsyq6zi214DpkngslM2K3AmJL6ObTN1AYHTLwA0klJ5yV3eF33N8WFD5OoL3c9O\" rel=\"noopener\">retriever</a> that’s pretrained to fetch relevant documents from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8k041XCLsyq6zi214DpkngslM2K3AmJL6ObTN1AYHTLwA0klJ5yV3eF33N8WFD5OoL3c9O\" rel=\"noopener\">Wikipedia</a> and <a href=\"https://commoncrawl.org/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8k041XCLsyq6zi214DpkngslM2K3AmJL6ObTN1AYHTLwA0klJ5yV3eF33N8WFD5OoL3c9O\" rel=\"noopener\">Common Crawl</a>, and a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8k041XCLsyq6zi214DpkngslM2K3AmJL6ObTN1AYHTLwA0klJ5yV3eF33N8WFD5OoL3c9O\" rel=\"noopener\">language model</a> that uses the documents in those datasets to respond to prompts.

One learned to produce an embedding of a prompt (when fine-tuning for, say, answering questions, it learned to produce an embedding of a question). The other learned to produce an embedding of a document, which was stored.</li><li>The language model, an encoder-decoder that produces its own embedding of the document, was trained by having it fill in missing words in Wikipedia and Common Crawl.</li><li>The authors further trained the retriever and language model on a similar task (but different loss functions). The language model, given new text with missing words and its own document embeddings, learned to fill in the missing words. The retriever, given the text with missing words, learned to identify documents that contain similar text. The retriever’s loss function encouraged it to rate documents as more similar to the prompt if the language model was more confident in the text it generated using those documents.</li><li>Given a prompt, the retriever compared it to its stored document embeddings and selected the 20 most relevant documents. Then, given the prompt and embeddings, the language model generated the output.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> MMLU offers four possible answers to each question, so random chance is 25 percent. Fine-tuned on five examples in MMLU, Atlas (11 billion parameters) achieved 47.9 percent average accuracy, while GPT-3 (175 billion parameters) achieved 43.9 percent average accuracy. (Atlas didn’t beat the 70-billion parameter Chinchilla, which achieved 67.5 average accuracy.) Fine-tuned on all MMLU training examples, Atlas achieved 66 percent average accuracy, while GPT-3 achieved 53.9 percent average accuracy. The questions in KILT’s Natural Questions subset are open-ended, so accuracy measures the percentage of outputs that exactly matched ground truth. Fine-tuned on 64 Natural Questions examples, Atlas achieved 42.4 percent accuracy, while next-best PaLM (540 billion parameters) achieved 39.6 percent accuracy. Fine-tuned on all Natural Questions training examples, Atlas achieved 60.4 percent accuracy, while the previous state of the art <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.73/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8k041XCLsyq6zi214DpkngslM2K3AmJL6ObTN1AYHTLwA0klJ5yV3eF33N8WFD5OoL3c9O\" rel=\"noopener\">R2-D2</a> (1.3 billion parameters) achieved 55.9 percent accuracy.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Training smaller models consumes less energy and costs less. Shifting the knowledge memorized by the model from the parameters into an external database not only reduces the number of necessary parameters, but also makes the model’s knowledge easier to update. Instead of retraining the model, you can simply extend the document database by feeding new data to the models and storing the resulting document embeddings.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Augmenting a language model’s training with retrieved documents is a promising avenue of research. <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/large-language-models-shrink/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">RETRO</a> did something similar, but it wasn’t fine-tuned on particular tasks, much less on a handful of examples.
