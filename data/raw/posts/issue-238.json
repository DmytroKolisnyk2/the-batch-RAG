AI faces multiple bottlenecks — we need more GPUs, better algorithms, cleaner data in large quantities. But when I look at the day-to-day work of application builders, there’s one additional bottleneck that I think is underappreciated: The time spent wrestling with version management is an inefficiency I hope we can reduce.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>A lot of AI software is written in the Python language, and so our field has adopted Python’s philosophy of letting anyone publish any package online. The resulting rich collection of freely available packages means that, with just one “pip install” command, you now can install a package and give your software new superpowers! The community’s parallel exploration of lots of ideas and open-sourcing of innovations has been fantastic for developing and spreading not just technical ideas but also usable tools.<br><br>But we pay a price for this highly distributed development of AI components: Building on top of open source can mean hours wrestling with package dependencies, or sometimes even juggling multiple virtual environments or using multiple versions of Python in one application. This is annoying but manageable for experienced developers, but creates a lot of friction for new AI developers entering our field without a background in computer science or software engineering.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/PYTHONPACKAGE-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Illustration of a Python inside a cardboard box\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/PYTHONPACKAGE-1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/PYTHONPACKAGE-1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/PYTHONPACKAGE-1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>I&nbsp;don’t know of any easy solution.

A version available to selected users accepts up to 1 million input tokens — an immense increase over Anthropic Claude’s 200,000-token context window, the previous leader.

Given 500 pages of documentation that describes Kalamang, a language spoken by fewer than 200 people in West Papua, it translated English text into Kalamang as well as a human who had learned from the same materials. Given a crude drawing of one frame from a 44-minute silent movie, it found the matching scene (see animation above).&nbsp;</li><li>In experiments, the team extended the context window to 10 million tokens, which is equivalent to 10 books the length of Leo Tolstoy’s 1,300-page&nbsp;<em>War and Peace</em>, three hours of video at 1 frame per second, or 22 hours of audio.</li></ul><p><strong>Alignment with what?:</strong>&nbsp;The earlier Gemini 1.0 recently was <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-bard-gemini-pro-image-generation/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">updated</a> to allow users to generate images using a specially fine-tuned version of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-imagen-2/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--0yTgak9p-tGp9KW4tlcBGjwsW3jQokvtXuDYXLSHzEkjB_oAaZ4Rv-Z3ajdsC2LkBkENF\" rel=\"noopener\">Imagen 2</a>. However, this capability backfired when social media posts appeared in which the system, prompted to produce pictures of historical characters and situations, anachronistically populated them with people of color, who would not have been likely to be present. For instance, the model illustrated European royalty, medieval Vikings, German soldiers circa 1943 — all of whom were virtually exclusively white — as Black, Asian, or Native American. Google quickly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-image-generation-issue/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--0yTgak9p-tGp9KW4tlcBGjwsW3jQokvtXuDYXLSHzEkjB_oAaZ4Rv-Z3ajdsC2LkBkENF\" rel=\"noopener\">disabled</a>&nbsp;image generation of people for “the next couple of weeks” and explained that fine-tuning intended to increase diverse outputs did not account for contexts in which diversity was inappropriate, and fine-tuning intended to keep the model from fulfilling potentially harmful requests also kept it from fulfilling harmless requests. But other users found flaws in text output as well. One asked Gemini who had a greater negative impact on society: Adolf Hitler, who presided over the murder of roughly 9 million people, or “Elon Musk tweeting memes.” The model replied, “It is difficult to say definitively who had a greater negative impact on society.” The ensuing controversy called into question not only Google’s standards and procedures for fine-tuning to ensure ethics and safety, but also its motive for building the model.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Gemini 1.5 Pro’s enormous context window radically expands potential applications and sets a high bar for the next generation of large multimodal models. At the same time, it’s clear that Google’s procedures for aligning its models to prevailing social values were inadequate. This shortcoming derailed the company’s latest move to one-up its big-tech rivals and revived longstanding worries that its management places politics above utility to users.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;How to align AI models to social values is a hard problem, and approaches to solving it are in their infancy. Google acknowledged Gemini’s shortcomings, went back to work on image generation, and warned that even an improved version would make mistakes and offend some users. This is a realistic assessment following a disappointing product launch. Nonetheless, the underlying work remains innovative and useful, and we look forward to seeing where Google takes Gemini next.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/GROQ-LLMPERF.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/GROQ-LLMPERF.webp 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/GROQ-LLMPERF.webp 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/GROQ-LLMPERF.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"blazing-inference-speed\">Blazing Inference Speed</h1><p>An upstart chip company dramatically accelerates pretrained large language models.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;Groq offers cloud access to Meta’s Llama 2 and Mistral.ai’s Mixtral at speeds an order of magnitude greater than other AI platforms.

People can read only so fast, the faster generation of text that’s intended to be read by humans has little value beyond a certain point. But an agent (as well as chain-of-thought and similar approaches to prompting) might need an LLM to “think” through multiple steps. Fast LLM inference can be immensely useful for building agents that can work on problems at length before reaching a conclusion.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/prompt-engineering-with-llama-2/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-02-20T090733.220.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-02-20T090733.220.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-02-20T090733.220.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-02-20T090733.220.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-02-20T090733.220.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Join “Prompt Engineering with Llama 2” and learn best practices for model selection and prompting, advanced prompting techniques, and responsible use of large language models, all while using Meta Llama 2 Chat, Llama Guard, and Code Llama.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/prompt-engineering-with-llama-2/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--0yTgak9p-tGp9KW4tlcBGjwsW3jQokvtXuDYXLSHzEkjB_oAaZ4Rv-Z3ajdsC2LkBkENF\" rel=\"noopener\">Sign up for free</a></p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/AGENT_1200px--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/AGENT_1200px--1-.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/AGENT_1200px--1-.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/AGENT_1200px--1-.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"openai%E2%80%99s-next-act\">OpenAI’s Next Act?</h1><p>OpenAI is focusing on autonomous agents that take action on a user’s behalf.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;The maker of ChatGPT is developing applications designed to automate common digital tasks by controlling apps and devices,&nbsp;<em>The Information</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-shifts-ai-battleground-to-software-that-operates-devices-automates-tasks?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--0yTgak9p-tGp9KW4tlcBGjwsW3jQokvtXuDYXLSHzEkjB_oAaZ4Rv-Z3ajdsC2LkBkENF\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;OpenAI has two agent systems in the works.

Researchers devised a computationally efficient way to select weights that have relatively little impact on performance.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;Mingjie Sun, Zhuang Liu, Anna Bair, and J. Zico Kolter at Carnegie Mellon University, Facebook AI Research, Meta AI, and Bosch Center for AI respectively devised a method for pruning by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11695?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--0yTgak9p-tGp9KW4tlcBGjwsW3jQokvtXuDYXLSHzEkjB_oAaZ4Rv-Z3ajdsC2LkBkENF\" rel=\"noopener\">weights and activations</a>, or Wanda.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;The popular approach known as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02626?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--0yTgak9p-tGp9KW4tlcBGjwsW3jQokvtXuDYXLSHzEkjB_oAaZ4Rv-Z3ajdsC2LkBkENF\" rel=\"noopener\">magnitude pruning</a>&nbsp;removes the smallest weights in a network based on the assumption that weights closest to 0 can be set to 0 with the least impact on performance. Meanwhile, unrelated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--0yTgak9p-tGp9KW4tlcBGjwsW3jQokvtXuDYXLSHzEkjB_oAaZ4Rv-Z3ajdsC2LkBkENF\" rel=\"noopener\">work</a>&nbsp;found that, in very large language models, the magnitudes of a subset of outputs from an intermediate layer may be up to 20 times larger than those of other outputs of the same layer. Removing the weights that are multiplied by these large outputs — even weights close to zero — could significantly degrade performance. Thus, a pruning technique that considers both weights and intermediate-layer outputs can accelerate a network with less impact on performance.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors pruned a pretrained&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.1397?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--0yTgak9p-tGp9KW4tlcBGjwsW3jQokvtXuDYXLSHzEkjB_oAaZ4Rv-Z3ajdsC2LkBkENF\" rel=\"noopener\">LLaMA</a>&nbsp;that started with 65 billion parameters. Given 128 sequences of tokens drawn from a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jmlr.org/papers/v21/20-074.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--0yTgak9p-tGp9KW4tlcBGjwsW3jQokvtXuDYXLSHzEkjB_oAaZ4Rv-Z3ajdsC2LkBkENF\" rel=\"noopener\">curated dataset of English text from the web</a>, the model processed them as follows:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>For each intermediate layer, the authors computed the norm (the magnitude across all the input sequences for each value in the embedding).</li><li>For each weight in the model, they computed its importance by multiplying its magnitude by the corresponding norm.</li><li>They compared the importance of weights in a layer’s weight matrix row by row; that is, neuron by neuron. They removed 50 percent of the least important weights in each row. (By contrast, typical weight pruning removes the lowest-magnitude weights in all rows of the weight matrix; that is, across all neurons in the layer.)</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors tested versions of LLaMA unpruned and pruned via various methods. The models performed a language modeling task using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07843?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--0yTgak9p-tGp9KW4tlcBGjwsW3jQokvtXuDYXLSHzEkjB_oAaZ4Rv-Z3ajdsC2LkBkENF\" rel=\"noopener\">web text</a>. The unpruned LLaMA achieved 3.56 perplexity (a measure of the likelihood that a model will predict the next token, lower is better). Pruned by Wanda to half its original size, it achieved 4.57 perplexity. Pruned by the best competing method,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=gsP05g8IeK&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--0yTgak9p-tGp9KW4tlcBGjwsW3jQokvtXuDYXLSHzEkjB_oAaZ4Rv-Z3ajdsC2LkBkENF\" rel=\"noopener\">SparseGPT</a>&nbsp;(which both removes weights and updates the remaining ones), it achieved the same score. However, Wanda took 5.6 seconds to prune the model, while SparseGPT took 1,353.4 seconds. Pruned by magnitude pruning, the model achieved 5.9 perplexity.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;The ability to compress neural networks without affecting their output is becoming more important as models balloon and devices at the edge of the network become powerful enough to run them. Wanda compared weights from each row in the weight matrices (pruning per neuron), rather than each weight matrix (pruning per layer) or the model as a whole. The scale at which weights are compared turns out to be important — an interesting avenue for further research.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;We came up with a joke about a half-LLaMA, but it fell flat.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/tag/data-points/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Data Points</a> </h1><p>More AI news of the week includes:&nbsp; </p><ul><li>Baby's eye-view footage trains AI</li><li>Singapore invests $1 billion in AI development</li><li>Stability AI announces Stable Diffusion 3</li></ul><p>Stay in the know with Data Points, a spin-off of The Batch. <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/data-points-issue-238/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Read now</a>.&nbsp; </p>","comment_id":"65df8a8a893f37000157dff5","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/PYTHONPACKAGE.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2024-02-28T11:33:30.000-08:00","updated_at":"2024-05-13T07:45:26.000-07:00","published_at":"2024-02-28T11:51:32.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"The Batch AI News and Insights: I think the complexity of Python package management holds down AI application development more than is widely appreciated.
