While having more data is helpful, large pretrained models make it practical to build viable systems using a very small labeled training set — perhaps just a handful of examples specific to your application.</em></p><p><em>About 10 years ago, with the rise of deep learning, I was one of the leading advocates for scaling up data and compute to drive progress. That recipe has carried us far, and it continues to drive progress in large language models, which are based on transformers. A similar recipe is emerging in computer vision based on large vision transformers.</em></p><p><em>But once those models are pretrained, it takes very little data to adapt them for a new task. With self-supervised learning, pretraining can happen on unlabeled data. So, technically, the model did need a lot of data for training, but that was unlabeled, general text or image data. Then, even with only a small amount of labeled, task-specific data, you can get good performance.</em></p><p><em>For example, say you have a transformer trained on a massive amount of text, and you want it to perform sentiment classification on your own dataset. The most common techniques are:</em></p><ul><li><em>Fine-tuning the model to your dataset. Depending on your application, this can be done with dozens or even fewer examples.</em></li><li><em>Few-shot learning. In this approach, you create a prompt that includes a few examples (that is, you write a text prompt that lists a handful of pieces of text and their sentiment labels). A common technique for this is <a href=\"https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/understanding-incontext/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--R0fcwA-dwPxxE55xo0PMWk7Q65CeYDIhLEqkr6-fb5qmHwWNZdjGcdmGp9D19vxv3EBxB\" rel=\"noopener\">in-context learning</a>.</em></li><li><em>Zero-shot learning, in which you write a prompt that describes the task you want done.</em></li></ul><p><em>These techniques work well. For example, customers of my team Landing AI have been building vision systems with dozens of labeled examples for years.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/05/DataSpheres_v6_1200px-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/DataSpheres_v6_1200px-1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/05/DataSpheres_v6_1200px-1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/05/DataSpheres_v6_1200px-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>The 2010s were the decade of large supervised models, I think the 2020s are shaping up to be the decade of large pretrained models. However, there is one important caveat: This approach works well for unstructured data (text, vision and audio) but not for structured data, and the majority of machine learning applications today are built on structured data.</em></p><p><em>Models that have been pretrained on diverse unstructured data found on the web generalize to a variety of unstructured data tasks of the same input modality. This is because text/images/audio on the web have many similarities to whatever specific text/image/audio task you might want to solve. But structured data such as tabular data is much more heterogeneous.

To match the neural network’s inference latency to that rate, the authors ran 50 neural networks of different sizes and measured their latency. Fitting a linear regression model to the latency and number of multiply-add operations a given network performed revealed that the number of multiply-add operations predicted execution speed almost perfectly. The magic number: 470,000.</li><li>The authors conducted a grid search of around 350 PilotNet variations that contained different layer widths and depths within the allowed number of multiply-adds. They trained each network and tested its accuracy.</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>The authors selected 16 models with various losses and latencies and tested them on the track. The best model completed seven laps before crashing. (Seven models failed to complete a single lap.) The models that managed at least one lap tended to achieve greater than 80 percent accuracy on the test set and latency lower than 100 milliseconds.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>This work shows neural networks, properly designed, can achieve useful results on severely constrained hardware. For a rough comparison, the Nvidia Tegra X2 processor that drives a Skydio 2+ drone provides four cores that run at 2 gigaHertz, while the Raspberry Pi Pico’s processor provides two cores running at 133 megaHertz. Neural networks that run on extremely low-cost, low-power hardware could lead to effective devices that monitor environmental conditions, health of agricultural crops, operation of remote equipment like wind turbines, and much more.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>Training a small network to deliver good performance is more difficult than training a larger one. New methods will be necessary to narrow the gap.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong>Stability AI released StableStudio, the open source version of DreamStudio</strong><br>The company also released a set of developer tools for local inference and desktop installation of the model.
