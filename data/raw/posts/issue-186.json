You have to collect data, implement a model or find an appropriate open-source model, build a data pipeline to get the data to the right place, develop or find a tool to label the data, train the model, tune hyperparameters, fix data issues, and eventually set up a deployment server and find a way to get the trained model to run on it.</em></p><p><em>This process used to take me months. With LandingLens, you can go from starting a project to deploying a model in minutes.</em></p><p><em>My team at Landing AI is obsessed with making computer vision easy. The key to making this possible is our data-centric AI approach. Our back end automatically trains a highly tuned model as long as you provide good data. After initial training, you can carry out error analysis and improve the data (or use advanced options to tune hyperparameters if you want) to further improve your model’s performance.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/ezgif.com-optimize--5--1-1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Landing AI's computer vision platform, LandingLens\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/ezgif.com-optimize--5--1-1.gif 600w\"></figure><p><em>LandingLens has been used successfully in manufacturing, life sciences, satellite imaging, medical imaging, agriculture, entertainment, and many other industries.</em></p><p><em>Today, companies can visualize and analyze their structured data to derive value from it using tools like pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and tableau.

Companies in that country are racing to cash in.</p><p><strong>Prompt:</strong> OpenAI doesn’t serve the model in China, but users there are reaching it through virtual private networks and offshore services that charge a fee per prompt. The chatbot reportedly impressed users in China with its ability to answer prompts in Chinese and its grasp of the country’s popular culture.</p><p><strong>Output: </strong>The country’s major tech firms in recent weeks revealed plans to provide their own equivalent services.</p><ul><li>Baidu <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/07/baidu-shares-leaps-as-it-reveals-plan-for-chatgpt-style-ernie-bot.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> Wenxin Yiyan (in English, Ernie Bot), a chatbot based on the company’s ERNIE language model, and plans to integrate it with its search engine and cloud services.</li><li>Alibaba is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/alibaba-says-it-is-developing-chatgpt-ai-tool-2023-02-08/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">developing</a> an unnamed prototype for integration with its enterprise chat app DingTalk.</li><li>Online retailer JD.com <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/OnAO_ejLndOPScZ0dkKwng?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">plans</a> to launch ChatJD for tasks like customer service and generating marketing copy and financial reports.</li><li>NetEase, a developer of online video games, <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/chinese-gaming-company-netease-will-use-chatgpt-like-ai-in-its-next-game/articleshow/98046708.cms?from=mdr&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">intends</a> to integrate a chatbot into one of its most popular games, Justice Online Mobile. The model will generate customized dialogue, characters, and other output.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news: </strong>Using an earlier generation of technology, Microsoft Research in China developed Xiaoice, a chatbot that continues to enjoy widespread use. More recently, Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence developed the 1.75 trillion-parameter Wu Dao 2.0. Nonetheless, Chinese researchers face unique obstacles in natural language processing.</p><ul><li>AI research in China has tended to <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-next-frontier-for-ai-in-china-could-add-600-billion-to-its-economy?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">focus</a> on computer vision applications like autonomous driving and face recognition rather than language applications.</li><li>Large-scale, Chinese-language datasets are difficult to compile. The internet contains far less Chinese than English text, and the portion of the internet available behind China’s Great Firewall is limited.</li><li>In September, the U.S. government <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/us-blocks-ai-chip-sales-to-china?utm_source=The+Batch&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=Computer+Vision+Made+Super+Easy\" rel=\"noopener\">restricted</a> sales to Chinese customers of high-performance processors used to train state-of-the-art AI systems.</li><li>A 2021 regulatory crackdown on some of China’s most prosperous tech companies incentivized a more cautious approach to growth.

Chinese tech companies are scrambling to capitalize on the public’s hunger for a chatbot that’s compatible with their language and culture.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Chinese speakers find ChatGPT exciting despite its relative lack of training in their language. When a model is sufficiently large, a large training corpus enables it to generalize to new languages that may not have much training data. This property offers hope for making large language models work with languages that have far less data than Chinese.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/BUZZFEED_v2a_1200px--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Buzzfeed's AI-generated quizzes\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/BUZZFEED_v2a_1200px--1-.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/BUZZFEED_v2a_1200px--1-.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/BUZZFEED_v2a_1200px--1-.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"publishers-embrace-text-generation\">Publishers Embrace Text Generation</h1><p>Media outlets are forging ahead with generative AI despite the technology’s high-profile misfires.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Publishers are using text generators to produce light reading within constrained formats such as holiday messages and quizzes.<br><br><strong>The lineup: </strong>Three publications, in particular, are taking various approaches to automated content.</p><ul><li><em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/13/opinion/valentines-day-chatgpt.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">published</a> an interactive feature that uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT to generate Valentine’s Day messages.

A human staff member comes up with a concept (such as “<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarahaspler/dream-date-fanfic?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Date your celebrity crush</a>”) and writes headlines and questions. Readers fill in text boxes or select among multiple choices, and GPT-3 generates a few paragraphs on the theme. The quizzes provide an opportunity to collect revenue from sponsors.

The change followed a notice that Replika’s San Francisco-based parent company, Luka, had violated the European Union’s transparency requirements.</p><p><strong>How it happened: </strong>Prior to the shift, Replika’s $70-per-year paid tier (which is still available) had enabled users to select the type of relationship with the bot they wished to pursue: friend, mentor, or romantic partner.</p><ul><li>On February 3, an Italian regulator <a href=\"https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9852506?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">found</a> Replika in violation of the European Union’s data-protection law. The EU deemed the service a risk to children and emotionally vulnerable individuals because the app doesn’t verify users’ ages or implement other protections. The regulator ordered Luka to stop processing Italian users’ data by February 23, 2023, or pay a fine of up to €20 million.</li><li>In the following days, users <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/replika/comments/10um66b/poll_will_you_cancel_your_subscription_if_what/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">complained</a> online that the chatbot no longer responded to their come-ons. Sometimes it replied with a blunt request to change the subject. Replika didn’t issue any statements that would have prepared users for the sudden change.</li><li>A week later, the administrator of a Facebook group devoted to Replika <a href=\"https://pokerfraudalert.com/forum/showthread.php?20366-Replika-the-supposed-lifelike-AI-quot-virtual-friend-quot-you-can-get-for-your-phone%2Fpage2=&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> Luka had confirmed that erotic chat was no longer allowed. Some paid users reported receiving refunds.</li></ul><p><strong>Like losing a loved one: </strong>Some users were deeply wounded by the abrupt change in their avatar’s persona, according to <em>Vice</em>. One said, “It’s hurting like hell.” Another compared the experience to losing a best friend.<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> In 2015, a friend of Replika founder Eugenia Kuyda died in a car accident. Seeking to hold a final conversation with him, Kuyda used his text messages to build a chatbot. The underlying neural network became the foundation of Replika. The service <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/bots-dont-need-social-distancing/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">gained</a> users in 2020 amid a pandemic-era hunger for social interaction.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>People need companionship, and AI can supply it when other options are scarce. But society also needs to try to protect individuals — especially the very young — from experiences that may be harmful. Companies that profit by fostering attachments between humans and machines may not be able to shield their users from emotional distress, but they can at least make sure those users are adults.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Eliza, a rule-based chatbot developed in the 1960s, showed that people can form an emotional bond with a computer program, and research <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563214002647?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">suggests</a> that some people are more comfortable sharing intimate details with a computer than with another human being. While we’re glad to see Replika phasing out problematic interactions, we sympathize with users who have lost an important emotional connection. Breaking up is hard — even with a chatbot.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/PCA--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Different illustration showing the application of PCA to color populations\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/PCA--1-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"pca-raises-red-flags\">PCA Raises Red Flags</h1><p>Principal component analysis is a key machine learning technique for reducing the number of dimensions in a dataset, but new research shows that its output can be inconsistent and unreliable.</p><p><strong>What’s new: </strong>Eran Elhaik at Lund University <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14395-4?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">assessed</a> the use of principal component analysis (PCA) in population genetics, the study of patterns in DNA among large groups of people. Working with synthetic and real-world datasets, he showed that using PCA on substantially similar datasets can produce contradictory results.</p><p><strong>Key insight: </strong>PCA has characteristics that prior research proposed as <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0020124&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">risk factors</a> for unreproducible scientific research. For instance, it tends to be used to generate hypotheses, accommodates flexible experimental designs that can lead to bias, and is used so frequently — in population genetics, at least — that many conclusions are likely to be invalid on a statistical basis alone. Studies of population genetics use PCA to reduce the dimensions of raw genetic data and cluster the reduced data to find patterns. For example, some studies assume that the closer different populations are clustered, the more likely they share a common geographical origin. If PCA alters the clusters in response to minor changes in the input, then the analysis doesn’t necessarily reflect genetic relationships.</p><p><strong>How it Works:</strong> The author tested the consistency of PCA-based analyses using a synthetic dataset and three real-world <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature19310?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">human</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1215040?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">genotype</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1004381107?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">datasets</a>.</p><ul><li>To create the synthetic dataset, the author modeled a simplified scenario in which people expressed one of three genes (signified by the colors red, green, and blue) or none (black). He assigned the vector [1,0,0] to each red individual, [0,1,0] to green, [0,0,1] to blue, and [0,0,0] to black. He used PCA to reduce the vectors into two dimensions and plotted the results on a 2D graph, so each group formed a cluster.</li><li>He used the real-world datasets to analyze 12 common tasks in population genetics, such as determining the geographical origin of population groups.</li><li>He ran several experiments on the synthetic and real-world data, manipulating the proportions of different populations, processing the data via PCA, and plotting the results.</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>Clustering a dataset that included 10 red, green, and blue examples and 200 black ones, the black cluster was roughly equidistant from the red, green, and blue clusters. However, with five fewer blue individuals, the black cluster was much closer to the blue cluster, showing that PCA can process similar data into significantly different cluster patterns. Using real-world data, the author replicated a 2009 <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08365?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> that used PCA to conclude that Indians were genetically distinct from European, Asian, and African populations. However, when he manipulated the proportion of non-Indian populations, the results suggested that Indians descend from Europeans, East Asians, or Africans. Overall, PCA-based analysis of the real-world datasets fluctuated arbitrarily enough to cast doubt on earlier research conclusions.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>This study demonstrates that PCA-based analyses can be irreproducible. This conclusion calls into question an estimated 32,000 to 216,000 genetic studies that used PCA as well as PCA-based analyses in other fields.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> PCA remains a useful tool for exploring data, but drawing firm conclusions from the resulting low-dimensional visualizations is often scientifically inappropriate.
