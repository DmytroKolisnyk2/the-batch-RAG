It takes so much less effort — and is so much cheaper — to write software with AI assistance than without. But beyond reducing the cost of writing software, AI is shortening the time from idea to working prototype, and the ability to test ideas faster is changing how teams explore and invent. When you can test 20 ideas per month, it dramatically changes what you can do compared to testing 1 idea per month. This is a benefit that comes from AI-enabled&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/hot-tips-for-speedy-startups/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--g7c5nbOAxyaHzLBSfH2SvzU56mKyBABM33ldUGOUEaGnFyl-_B3i2TWTgENgoPJkhXzaw\" rel=\"noopener\">speed</a>&nbsp;rather than AI-enabled cost reduction.</p><p>That AI-enabled automation can reduce costs is well understood. For example, providing automated customer service is cheaper than operating human-staffed call centers. Many businesses are more willing to invest in growth than just in cost savings; and, when a task becomes cheaper, some businesses will do a lot more of it, thus creating growth. But another recipe for growth is underrated: Making certain tasks much faster (whether or not they also become&nbsp;cheaper) can create significant new value.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/unnamed--88-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Black stopwatch icon showing elapsed time, commonly used to represent speed, countdowns, or time tracking.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/unnamed--88-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/unnamed--88-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/unnamed--88-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>I see this pattern across more and more businesses. Consider the following scenarios:</p><ul><li>If a lender can approve loans in minutes using AI, rather than days waiting for a human to review them, this creates more borrowing opportunities (and also lets the lender deploy its capital faster). Even if human-in-the-loop review is needed, using AI to get the most important information to the reviewer might speed things up. The ability to provide loans quickly opens up the market to new customers in need of rapid funds and helps customers who need a quick positive or negative decision to accept the loan or move on.</li><li>If an academic institution gives homework feedback to students in minutes (via sophisticated autograding) rather than days (via human grading), not only is the automation cheaper, the rapid feedback facilitates better learning.</li><li>If an online seller can approve purchases faster, this can lead to more sales. For example, many platforms that accept online ad purchases have an approval process that can take hours or days; if approvals can be done faster, they can earn revenue faster. Further, for customers buying ads, being able to post an ad in minutes lets them test ideas faster&nbsp;and also makes the ad product more valuable.</li><li>If a company’s sales department can prioritize leads and respond to prospective customers in minutes or hours rather than days — closer to when the customers’ buying intent first led them to contact the company — sales representatives&nbsp;might close more deals. Likewise, a business that can respond more quickly to requests for proposals may win more deals.</li></ul><p>I’ve written previously about looking at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWyCJ35YWbZHN5MR1QQtQmkrW5tZZwQ5wzzzcN26s6103qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3n1VPPk5R4h379YW1tMcHL3yxSymW1JMvfH833Zs7W1PCdj52trr_2W8bq2976XKQ7fMst5w-SsvdqW8NXvY31sYGc-W2jsRG03W2rL1W3xKrx-4G0D38W2vScjV5ZdFzWW22jJxK7Kc2ftW2ybwV_37yr6PW3ZRqQQ1CBP6hW5qdsVV8cw4pZW2Z9YWf3M0P05W22CVWt1LRbCTW6nZ1Bm2cVWn8W8w27Q67lZKQXW3N-brj1ymMpWW7Fr3VK2SZnKhW6wfr-f7NSs98W58c8FC55NtrmW7mDcwq4yjLPjW5fVLgV3Q453GN7rzWVl8b08hW6jNq9p2YQmTJW2GFsCB949cWWW6zmLhd4JJK7rf2NxVYM04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">tasks</a>&nbsp;a company does to explore where AI can help. Many teams already do this with an eye toward making tasks cheaper, either to save costs or to do those tasks many more times. If you’re doing this exercise, consider also whether AI can significantly speed up certain tasks. One place to examine is the sequence of tasks on the path to earning revenue. If some of the steps can be sped up, perhaps this can help revenue growth.</p><p>Growth is more interesting to most businesses than cost savings, and if there are loops in your business that, when sped up, would drive growth, AI might be a tool to unlock this growth.</p><p>Keep building!</p><p>Andrew</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/data-analytics/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-05-13T182227.067.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Promo banner for: &quot;Data Analytics Professional Certificate&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-05-13T182227.067.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-05-13T182227.067.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-05-13T182227.067.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-05-13T182227.067.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>In Course 4 of the&nbsp;<em>Data Analytics Professional Certificate</em>&nbsp;you’ll work with truly real-world data: messy, inconsistent, and often unstructured.

This phenomenon suggests a need either for larger, high-quality, supervised fine-tuning datasets or for fine-tuning via both supervised learning and reinforcement learning.</li><li>To minimize discrepancies in output length, the authors tested multiple prompts and chose those that resulted in the most uniform output lengths.</li><li>To address the output batches that received mostly negative rewards, they sampled lots of responses, retained those that received a positive reward, sampled an equal number of those that received a negative reward, and discarded the rest before adjusting the model’s weights.</li></ul><p><strong>Larger model lessons learned:</strong>&nbsp;Phi-4-reasoning and Phi-4-reasoning-plus didn’t present the same issues. However, the authors did make significant choices during reinforcement learning:</p><ul><li>They fine-tuned Phi-4-reasoning on both math and code data, but during reinforcement learning, they fine-tuned it only on math data&nbsp;to simplify the training process. The authors attribute the model’s relatively lackluster performance on code benchmarks to this choice.</li><li>They crafted the reward function to give lower rewards for correct responses longer than 25,600 tokens than for shorter responses. This encouraged the model to finish thinking within the input length. Furthermore, the reward function gave a greater punishment for incorrect responses with fewer&nbsp;than 3,702 tokens compared to longer responses. This encouraged the model to produce more reasoning tokens when solving hard problems.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;Overall, Phi-4-reasoning-plus and Phi-4-mini-reasoning outperform similarly sized (and larger) open-weights models on math problems. Phi-4-reasoning generally outperformed DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-70B but underperformed Alibaba&nbsp;QwQ 32B. All three models deliver performance that falls in the middle among&nbsp;proprietary models and, in domains outside math, larger models with open weights.</p><ul><li>On math problems in AIME 2024, Phi-4-reasoning-plus (81.3 percent accuracy) outperformed the next-best open-weights model, QwQ 32B (79.5 percent accuracy). In comparison, Phi-4-reasoning (74.6 percent accuracy) underperformed the proprietary Gemini 2.5 Pro (92 percent accuracy).</li><li>On AIME 2024, Phi-4-mini-reasoning (57.5 percent accuracy) outperformed the next-best open-weights model of similar size, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B (53.3 percent accuracy).

They&nbsp;compute&nbsp;vectors, which may capture details like names or dates that were learned through training, and retrieve them according to a given input. Computing the output of a memory layer&nbsp;is similar to computing that of a self-attention layer. Both describe vectors that represent queries, keys, and values, and both compute the similarity between queries and keys and then weight the values by that similarity. However, while a self-attention layer computes queries, keys, and values from linear transformations of the input, a memory layer (which computes queries the same way) learns keys and a corresponding&nbsp;value for each key&nbsp;through training.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;Memory layers can be scaled to millions of keys, but computing the similarity between a query and so many keys is computationally expensive. One solution is to represent each key as a combination of two half-keys drawn from two much smaller sets. For example, two sets of 1,000 half-keys each can represent 1 million possible keys. Comparing a query to these smaller sets is much more efficient, making it practical to scale up memory layers dramatically.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors pretrained Llama-style models of several sizes (from 134 million to 8 billion parameters) on data similar to Llama 2’s and Llama 3’s pretraining datasets. They replaced the fully connected layers with memory layers in three transformer blocks. These layers shared parameters and held up to 16 million values (an extra 64 billion parameters total). The memory layers&nbsp;performed these steps:</p><ul><li>Given a query (a prompt that has been embedded by preceding transformer layers), split it into two vectors&nbsp;half the size.</li><li>Compute similarity scores between each half-query to and each half-key drawn from two sets of half&nbsp;keys. Identify the&nbsp;<em>k</em>&nbsp;highest-scoring half-keys.&nbsp;</li><li>Concatenate the highest-scoring half&nbsp;keys to produce&nbsp;<em>k<sup>2</sup></em>&nbsp;full keys.&nbsp;</li><li>Sum the similarity scores of the two half keys that make up each full key. Choose the k highest-scoring full keys.</li><li>Compute the index of each full key based on the indices of the corresponding half-keys.</li><li>Retrieve the values that correspond to the full keys.</li><li>Output the summed values weighted by the similarity scores.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors compared a model (8 billion parameters) with memory layers to a similar model without memory layers, both trained on 1 trillion tokens.</p><ul><li>They used nine question-answering datasets for evaluation. The model with memory layers achieved higher performance on seven of them. For example, on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--g7c5nbOAxyaHzLBSfH2SvzU56mKyBABM33ldUGOUEaGnFyl-_B3i2TWTgENgoPJkhXzaw\" rel=\"noopener\">MMLU</a>, the memory model achieved 63.04 percent accuracy, while the unmodified transformer achieved 59.68 percent accuracy.&nbsp;</li><li>In general, the memory model performed worse than Llama 3.1 8B trained on 15 trillion tokens. For example, Llama 3.1 8B achieved 66 percent accuracy on MMLU.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Memory layers didn’t catch on in the early days of large language models (LLMs), but they can improve the output of today’s much bigger models. LLMs&nbsp;outfitted with memory layers require less data and computation for pretraining than conventional models to achieve the same result, at least with respect to answering factual questions.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;While retrieval-augmented generation can help LLMs deliver more-factual output by retrieving facts from a database, the authors add trainable parameters for this purpose.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai-1\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/mcp-build-rich-context-ai-apps-with-anthropic?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-05-13T182128.677.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Promo banner for: &quot;MCP: Build Rich-Context AI Apps with Anthropic&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-05-13T182128.677.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-05-13T182128.677.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-05-13T182128.677.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-05-13T182128.677.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Build AI applications that access tools, data, and prompt templates using Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard developed by Anthropic.
