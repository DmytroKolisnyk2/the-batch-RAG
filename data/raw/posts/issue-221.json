The order follows a six-month process of consultation with the AI community and other stakeholders.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The executive order interprets existing law — specifically the Cold War-era Defense Production Act, a Cold War-era law that gives the president powers to promote national defense and respond to emergencies — and thus can be implemented without further legislation. It focuses on foundation models, or general-purpose models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks:</p><ul><li><strong>Safety:&nbsp;</strong>Developers must notify the government when they train a model whose processing budget exceeds 10<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;integer or floating-point operations, which corresponds roughly to 1 trillion parameters, with a lower limit for training on biological sequences.

The executive order organizes the federal bureaucracy to grapple with the challenges of AI and prepares the way for national legislation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;We need laws to ensure that AI is safe, fair, and transparent, and the executive order has much good in it. But it’s also problematic in fundamental ways. For instance, foundation models are the wrong focus. Burdening basic technology development with reporting and standards places a drag on innovation. It makes more sense to regulate&nbsp;<em>applications</em>&nbsp;that carry known risks, such as underwriting tools, healthcare devices, and autonomous vehicles. We welcome regulations that promote responsible AI and look forward to legislation that limits risks without hampering innovation.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/TRANSPARENCY.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Foundation Model Transparency Index by The Stanford Center for Research of Foundation Models\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/TRANSPARENCY.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/TRANSPARENCY.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/TRANSPARENCY.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"what-we-know-%E2%80%94-and-don%E2%80%99t-know-%E2%80%94-about-foundation-models\">What We Know — and Don’t Know — About Foundation Models</h1><p>A new index ranks popular AI models in terms of information their developers provide about their training, architecture, and usage.

They scored each model by asking 100 yes-or-no questions that covered training, model architecture and behavior, and policies regarding access and usage.</p><ul><li><strong>Training:&nbsp;</strong>Roughly one-third of the questions asked questions related to training, like whether factors like processing, hardware, and training data used to build the model are disclosed. They also asked whether external parties have access to the dataset and whether steps were taken to protect data privacy or intellectual property.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Architecture and behavior:&nbsp;</strong>Around one-third of the questions enquired about the trained model, such as whether a developer disclosed details about a model’s architecture, capabilities, and limitations. They also asked whether independent researchers were able to test the model and evaluate its risks and trustworthiness.</li><li><strong>Access and usage:</strong>&nbsp;The final third of the questions asked about how the model can be used, including whether the model is available to all prospective users, whether restrictions apply to such uses, and whether use requires an explicit license. They also gauged whether users are notified that they’re interacting with an AI model, whether user data is stored, whether a log of versions is provided, and whether a list of applications based on the model is available.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The index assigned each model a score&nbsp; between 1 and 100. Meta’s Llama 2 ranked most transparent with a score of 54. BigScience’s BLOOM-Z came in just behind with a score of 53. At the bottom of the list were Inflection’s Inflection-1, which scored 21, and Amazon’s Titan Text, which scored 12.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Three of the four highest-scoring models — Llama 2, BLOOMZ, and Stability.AI’s Stable Diffusion 2 — were released with model weights. Meanwhile, the six lowest-scoring models were closed models.</li><li>On average, the models showed the greatest transparency with respect to access and usage. They were least transparent with respect to training.</li><li>Transparency ratings did not correlate with company size. For instance, the top spots were occupied by Llama 2 from the giant Meta and BLOOMZ from BigScience, a much smaller organization.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong>&nbsp;Because the index is limited to yes/no questions, it doesn’t allow for partial credit. In addition, the questions are weighted equally, so lack of transparency in an important area (say, access to training data) costs only one point in a model’s overall score. It’s easy to imagine companies gaming the scores rather than addressing the most meaningful deficits.</p><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong>&nbsp;Researchers at MIT, Cohere For AI, and 11 other organizations recently launched the Data Provenance Platform, a project that audits and categorizes training datasets. The effort offers a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dataprovenance.org/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_l2Vp7pfRh2AuRkSIQH_PqaAzObJLq2iZbONqHUKV0VyQx-Wfek9yyyqhnKPF_D2myM65F\" rel=\"noopener\">Data Provenance Explorer</a>&nbsp;for evaluating sources, licenses, creators, and other metadata with respect to roughly 1,800 text datasets.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;AI has a transparency problem, and the rise of models that serve as foundations for other models exacerbates the issue. Without disclosure of fundamental factors like architectures, datasets, and training methods, it’s impossible to replicate research, evaluate cost per performance, and address biases. Without disclosure of applications based on a given foundation model, it’s impossible to weigh those applications’ capabilities and limitations. A consistent set of criteria for evaluating transparency may encourage greater disclosure.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;The rise of open source AI has been accompanied by an opposite rise in commercial concerns that have little incentive to reveal the inner workings of their models. An index encourages everyone to provide detailed information about the systems they build, and we hope it will help engineers who care about transparency to persuade their teammates. We look forward to refinements and expansion to cover models that aren’t included among the initial 10.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-for-everyone/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--72-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"&quot;Generative AI for Everyone&quot; course promotional banner\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--72-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--72-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--72-.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--72-.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Andrew Ng’s new course, “Generative AI for Everyone,” is live on Coursera!

Synthetic captions can help them follow prompts more closely.</p><p><strong>What’s new:&nbsp;</strong>James Betker, Gabriel Goh, Li Jing, and Aditya Ramesh at OpenAI, along with colleagues at Microsoft,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/papers/dall-e-3.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_l2Vp7pfRh2AuRkSIQH_PqaAzObJLq2iZbONqHUKV0VyQx-Wfek9yyyqhnKPF_D2myM65F\" rel=\"noopener\">improved</a>&nbsp;a latent diffusion model’s performance by training it on an image-caption dataset including model-generated captions that were more detailed than those typically scraped from the web. They used the same technique to train DALL·E 3, the latest version of OpenAI’s text-to-image generator.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;Text-to image generators learn about the relationships between images and their descriptions from datasets of paired images and captions. The captions in typical image-caption datasets are limited to general descriptions of image subjects, with few details about the subjects and little information about their surroundings, image style, and so on. This makes models trained on them relatively insensitive to elaborate prompts. However, language models can generate captions in great detail. Training on more-detailed synthetic captions can give an image generator a richer knowledge of the correspondence between words and pictures.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;Rather than reveal details about DALL·E 3’s architecture and training, the authors describe training a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_l2Vp7pfRh2AuRkSIQH_PqaAzObJLq2iZbONqHUKV0VyQx-Wfek9yyyqhnKPF_D2myM65F\" rel=\"noopener\">latent diffusion model</a>.</p><ul><li>The authors trained a transformer language model on an unspecified dataset of image-caption pairs.

They retained 5 percent of the original human-made captions.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors trained separate latent diffusion models on datasets containing 95 percent generated captions and 100 percent human-made captions. They used the models to generate 50,000 images each and used OpenAI’s CLIP to calculate a similarity score (higher is better) between the prompts and generated images. The model trained on synthetic captions achieved 27.1 CLIP similarity, while a model trained on human-made captions achieved 26.8 CLIP similarity.</p><p><strong>Testing DALL·E 3:</strong>&nbsp;The authors also tested human responses to images generated by DALL·E 3, Midjourney 5.2, and Stable Diffusion XL v1.0.
