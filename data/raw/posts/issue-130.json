Beyond the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03187-3?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9IwRffQa-FhbJmJPU-xyUJWn47fPfcIZ5nB4UsaxRWb4u4c6galPW0cpLOCUiLOPCbZUg3\" rel=\"noopener\">ethical issues</a> that arise in collecting pictures of people, they require that every pixel of every image be labeled. Creating high-quality synthetic images can be similarly difficult, since a digital artist must design each face individually. A controllable 3D model can ease the burden of producing and labeling realistic portraits.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors used a high-quality 3D model of a face, comprising over 7,000 polygons and vertices as well as four joints, that changes shape depending on parameters defining a unique identity, expression, and pose. They fit the model to the average face derived from 500 scans of people with diverse backgrounds.</p><ul><li>Given the average face, the authors derived the identity, pose, and expression from each of the 500 scans. They added further expressions from a dataset of 27,000 expression parameters. Meanwhile, artists produced a library of skin textures, facial expressions, facial hair, clothing, and accessories.</li><li>To create novel faces, the authors fit a distribution to match that of the real-world identity parameters and sampled from it. Then they applied elements from the library to render 100,000 face images.</li><li>They trained a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9IwRffQa-FhbJmJPU-xyUJWn47fPfcIZ5nB4UsaxRWb4u4c6galPW0cpLOCUiLOPCbZUg3\" rel=\"noopener\">U-Net</a> encoder-decoder to classify each pixel as belonging to the right or left eye, right or left eyebrow, top or bottom lip, head or facial hair, neck, eyeglasses, and so on. The loss function minimized the difference between predicted and ground-truth labels.</li><li>Given real-life faces from the <a href=\"http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~vuongle2/helen/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9IwRffQa-FhbJmJPU-xyUJWn47fPfcIZ5nB4UsaxRWb4u4c6galPW0cpLOCUiLOPCbZUg3\" rel=\"noopener\">Helen</a> dataset, the authors used the U-Net to classify each pixel. Then, given the U-Net's output, they trained a second U-Net to transform the predicted classifications to be similar to the human labels. This label adaptation step helped the system’s output to match biases in the human-annotated test data (for example, where a nose ended and the rest of the face began).</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors compared their system to a U-Net trained using images in Helen. Their system recognized the part of the face each pixel belonged to with an overall F1 score (a number between 0 and 1 that represents the balance between precision and recall, higher is better) of 0.920. The comparison model scored 0.916. This result fell somewhat short of the state of the art, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11240?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9IwRffQa-FhbJmJPU-xyUJWn47fPfcIZ5nB4UsaxRWb4u4c6galPW0cpLOCUiLOPCbZUg3\" rel=\"noopener\">EAGRNet</a>, which achieved an F1 score of 0.932 in the same task.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Synthetic data is handy when the real thing is hard to come by. Beyond photorealistic, annotated faces, the authors’ method can produce similarly high-quality ultraviolet and depth images. It can also generate and label images outside the usual data distribution in a controllable way.<br><br><strong>We're thinking:</strong> The authors generated an impressive diversity of realistic faces and expressions, but they were limited from the library of 512 discrete hairstyles, 30 items of clothing, and 54 accessories. We look forward to work that enables a 3D model to render these features as well.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table class=\"hse-image-wrapper\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px !important;\"><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(59, 59, 59); word-break: break-word; text-align: center; padding: 5px 0px 10px; font-size: 0px;\"><img alt=\"REGS\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/5871640/hubfs/REGS.gif?upscale=true&amp;width=1200&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=REGS.gif\" width=\"600\" align=\"middle\" class=\"stretch-on-mobile\" style=\"outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width: 100%; font-size: 16px;\"></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"roadblocks-to-regulation\">Roadblocks to Regulation</h1><p>Most U.S. state agencies use AI without limits or oversight.

Insiders blame big tech.</p><p><strong>Why it hasn’t happened:</strong> Reporters interviewed lawmakers and lobbyists about dozens of stalled bills. They found that bureaucracy and lobbying have played major roles in blocking legislation.</p><ul><li>Bureaucratic roadblocks: Lawmakers reported difficulty finding out from government agencies which AI tools they were using and how. This is partly due to the agencies’ lack of cooperation and partly because the lawmakers don’t understand the technology well enough to probe the full range of potential uses.</li><li>Industry resistance: Tech companies and their lobbyists have stymied passage of bills by arguing that their provisions are overly broad and would impact non-AI systems like traffic light cameras, DNA tests, and gunshot analysis. In California, an alliance of 26 tech groups derailed a bill that would have asked contractors to submit an impact report when making a bid. They argued that the legislation would limit participation, discourage innovation, and cost taxpayers.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Although U.S. states are mostly free to use AI, several of them impose limits on private companies.</p><ul><li>Last year, New York City <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-artificial-intelligence-2fe8d3ef7008d299d9d810f0c0f7905d?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9IwRffQa-FhbJmJPU-xyUJWn47fPfcIZ5nB4UsaxRWb4u4c6galPW0cpLOCUiLOPCbZUg3\" rel=\"noopener\">passed</a> a law that requires private employers to audit automated hiring systems for gender and racial bias before putting them to use. The law, which goes into effect in 2023, also requires employers to notify candidates when they automate hiring and to offer an alternative.</li><li>A Colorado law set to take effect in 2023 will <a href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb21-169?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9IwRffQa-FhbJmJPU-xyUJWn47fPfcIZ5nB4UsaxRWb4u4c6galPW0cpLOCUiLOPCbZUg3\" rel=\"noopener\">ban</a> insurance companies from using algorithms that discriminate against potential customers based on factors including age, race, and religion.

The lack of such limits in the U.S. make it an outlier. On one hand, this leaves the authorities free to experiment and perhaps discover productive use cases. On the other, it invites abuse — or simply lack of quality control over a technology that has great potential for both good and ill.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Regulation done badly is a drag on progress. Done right, though, it can prevent harm, level the playing field for innovators, and ensure that benefits are widespread. The AI community should push back against special interests — even when we would profit — that stymie regulation that would be good for society.</p>","comment_id":"61fae73d517bb7003baed538","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-02-at-10.08.40-AM.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-02-02T12:19:09.000-08:00","updated_at":"2022-10-05T15:01:49.000-07:00","published_at":"2022-02-02T12:22:07.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"I’m writing this in Orlando, Florida, where I just spoke at the A3 Business Forum, a group that works to advance industrial automation through AI, robotics, and other tools.
