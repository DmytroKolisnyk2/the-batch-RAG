Some standout trends:</p><ul><li>Private investment in AI grew last year by 9.3 percent despite the pandemic’s chilling effect on the global economy. Drug development saw the most explosive growth, reaping nearly $13.8 billion from investors compared to just under $2.5 billion in 2019. Autonomous vehicles came in second with $4.5 billion followed by educational applications with roughly $4.1 billion.</li><li>Sixty-five percent of newly minted PhDs in North America last year took jobs with private companies rather than academia or government, up from 44 percent in 2010. Universities were the top source of U.S. AI research, but corporations published roughly 19 percent of peer-reviewed research papers.</li><li>China has produced the highest volume of AI research for years, but in 2020 it also received the most academic citations. The U.S offered the most undergraduate and master’s programs. Nearly two-thirds of AI PhDs in the U.S. went to students from other countries.</li><li>U.S. legislation and congressional reports mentioned AI 486 times during the 2019-20 session, a threefold increase over the previous session, suggesting that lawmakers are taking a bigger role in determining the technology’s future.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> AI is a rising tide, but it’s not yet lifting all boats. Women made up only 16 percent of tenure-track computer science faculty worldwide in 2019 and about 18 percent of AI and computer science PhDs awarded in North America over the last decade. Meanwhile, Hispanics and Blacks accounted for only 3.2 and 2.3 percent respectively of U.S. AI PhDs in 2019.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Private industry’s embrace of AI means more of the technology will be put to real-world use. The growth in corporate research could benefit the field as a whole, though it also highlights the urgent need for well defined standards in technology development, implementation, and auditing. <br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> The figures for women and minorities in AI are unconscionable. AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue to do so.  But practices are evolving rapidly, and we have only a short time left to make sure this wealth is fairly shared across genders, ethnicities, and nations. We urge governments, companies, and citizens to act quickly to promote AI’s broad positive impact. </p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Batch-Ad-March-3rd-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Become a machine learning engineer with FourthBrain’s 16-week, live, online, instructor-led program.

But is it always true? A new study reached surprising conclusions.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Alexander Ke, William Ellsworth, Oishi Banerjee, and colleagues at Stanford systematically <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06871?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_-bpm3lEK5y9FPV6o9CgFsFsZXGafSvQy0TAKpj6vZRS2gq8TGr5pNL-zwlKMsKuvTqdna5-usqBFG3rkdCTYeGGwLSQ\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tested</a> various models that were pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned to read X-rays. They found that accuracy on ImageNet did not correlate with performance on the fine-tuned tasks. The team also included Andrew Ng and Pranav Rajpurkar, instructor of DeepLearning.AI’s AI for Medicine Specialization.<br><br><strong>Key insight: </strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08974?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_-bpm3lEK5y9FPV6o9CgFsFsZXGafSvQy0TAKpj6vZRS2gq8TGr5pNL-zwlKMsKuvTqdna5-usqBFG3rkdCTYeGGwLSQ\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Previous work</a> found that accuracy on ImageNet prior to fine-tuning correlated strongly with accuracy on some vision tasks afterward. But ImageNet images differ from X-rays, and model architecture also influences results — so knowledge gained from ImageNet may not transfer to medical images.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors evaluated the impact of published ImageNet performance, ImageNet training, and parameter count on the fine-tuned performance of six convolutional neural net architectures (including older ones such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_-bpm3lEK5y9FPV6o9CgFsFsZXGafSvQy0TAKpj6vZRS2gq8TGr5pNL-zwlKMsKuvTqdna5-usqBFG3rkdCTYeGGwLSQ\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ResNet </a>and newer ones such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_-bpm3lEK5y9FPV6o9CgFsFsZXGafSvQy0TAKpj6vZRS2gq8TGr5pNL-zwlKMsKuvTqdna5-usqBFG3rkdCTYeGGwLSQ\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EfficientNet</a>) in a variety of sizes.

To compensate for potential variations in implementation, they tested each model’s performance periodically during training, saved copies, and evaluated an ensemble of the 10 best performers. They gauged performance via the area under the curve (AUC), a measure of true versus false positives where 1 is a perfect score.</p><ul><li>To learn whether ImageNet performance correlated with performance on CheXpert, they compared each fine-tuned model’s CheXpert AUC with the pretrained version’s published ImageNet accuracy.</li><li>To find the impact of ImageNet pretraining, they compared models pretrained on ImageNet with randomly initialized versions.</li><li>To learn whether a model’s size correlated with its performance after pretraining and fine-tuning, they compared its parameter count to CheXpert AUC.</li><li>Prior to fine-tuning, they removed up to four blocks from each model and compared CheXpert performance after different degrees of truncation.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The team found no correlation between ImageNet accuracy and average CheXpert AUC scores after fine-tuning. Specifically, for pretrained models, the Spearman correlation was 0.082. Without pretraining, it was 0.059. However, ImageNet pretraining did lead to an average boost of 0.016 AUC in fine-tuned performance. For models without pretraining, the architecture influenced performance more than the parameter count did.

Moreover, state-of-the-art ImageNet models are not necessarily ideal for processing domain-specific data.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Language models have made huge advances through pretraining plus fine-tuning.
