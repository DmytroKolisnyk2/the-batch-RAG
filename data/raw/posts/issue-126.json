And if something unforeseen happens, I ask myself, “Would my collaborators be surprised if they were to hear this news from someone else?” If the answer is yes, I try to reach out quickly to let them know myself.</em><br><br><em>I find this rule useful when thinking about AI systems, too.

It observes reinforcement learning agents in an economic simulation and sets tax rates that promote their general welfare.<br><br><strong>Key insight: </strong>Economic simulations often use pre-programmed agents to keep the computation manageable, but hard-coding makes it difficult to study the impact of tax rates on agent behavior. A reinforcement learning (RL) system that accommodates different types of agents can enable worker agents to optimize their own outcomes in response to tax rates, while a policy-maker agent adjusts tax rates in response to the workers’ actions. This dual optimization setup can find a balanced optimum between the interests of individual workers and the policy maker.<br><br><strong>How it works: </strong>Four workers inhabited a two-dimensional map, 25 squares per side. One episode spanned 10 tax periods, each lasting 100 time steps. The policy maker changed tax rates after each period. Workers sought high income and low labor individually, while the policy maker pursued social welfare, the product of the average difference in incomes and the sum of all incomes.</p><ul><li>The workers and policy maker were convolutional LSTMs trained using <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_b5YU_giZqMphpjP3eK_9R707BZmFqcVui_47YdrVFGr6uFjyPLc_tBdJVBE-KNeXlTQ_m\" rel=\"noopener\">proximal policy optimization</a> (PPO).</li><li>Workers learned whether to move, gather building materials, sell them to each other for coins, build houses, sell houses, or do nothing.

It distributed tax revenue equally among workers.</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>The authors observed several realistic phenomena. Workers specialized: Skilled builders constructed houses while others gathered materials. There was a tradeoff between productivity and quality; that is, more-productive builders produced houses of lower quality. And workers developed strategies to game the system by, say, delaying a house sale to a later period when the tax rate might be lower.

But the department has had difficulty collaborating with big tech: In 2018, over 4,000 Google employees protested the company’s involvement in a DOD program called Project Maven, highlighting qualms among many AI professionals about military uses of their work. DOD’s new emphasis on ethics may portend a smoother relationship ahead between big tech and the military.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> The document doesn't mention fully autonomous weapons, but they lurk in the background of any discussion of military AI.

While this practice, known as active learning, can supply labeled examples that improve performance in some tasks, it fails in others. A new study sheds light on why.<br><br><strong>What's new:</strong> Siddharth Karamcheti and colleagues at Stanford University <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02331?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_b5YU_giZqMphpjP3eK_9R707BZmFqcVui_47YdrVFGr6uFjyPLc_tBdJVBE-KNeXlTQ_m\" rel=\"noopener\">showed</a> that examples of a certain kind hinder active learning in visual question answering (VQA), where a model answers questions about images.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Most active learning methods aim to label examples that a model is least certain about. This approach assumes that providing labels that resolve the model’s uncertainty will improve performance faster than providing labels that confirm its certainty. However, some examples that prompt uncertainty are also difficult to learn, and the uncertainty doesn’t dissipate with additional learning. For instance, in VQA, some questions about an image may refer to information that’s absent from the image itself; consider a photo of a car and the question, “What is the symbol on the hood often associated with?” If an active learning algorithm were choose many such examples, the additional labels would contribute little to learning. For active learning to work, it needs to choose examples the model can learn from. Thus, removing hard-to-learn examples prior to active learning should improve the results.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors trained several VQA models on a variety of datasets.
