Microsoft kept its Office of Responsible AI, which formulates ethical rules and principles, and related teams that advise senior leadership on responsible AI and help implement responsible AI tools in the cloud.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> Ethics &amp; Society was charged with ensuring that AI products and services were deployed according to Microsoft’s stated <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ethical-ai-2-0/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">principles</a>. At its 2020 peak, it included around 30 employees including engineers, designers, and philosophers. Some former members spoke with <em>Platformer</em> anonymously.</p><ul><li>As business priorities shifted toward pushing AI products into production, the company moved Ethics &amp; Society staff to other teams, leaving seven members prior to the recent layoffs.</li><li>Former team members said that the prior round of downsizing had made it difficult for them to do their jobs.</li><li>They also said that other teams often would not listen to their feedback. For example, Ethics &amp; Society warned that Bing Image Creator, a text-to-image generator based on OpenAI’s DALL·E 2, would harm the earning potential of human artists and result in negative press. Microsoft launched the model without having implemented proposed strategies to mitigate the risk.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news: </strong>Microsoft isn’t the only major AI player to have shifted its approach to AI governance.</p><ul><li>Earlier this month, OpenAI began providing access to GPT-4 without supplying information on its model architecture or dataset, a major departure from its founding <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ideal</a> of openness. “In a few years, it’s going to be completely obvious to everyone that open-sourcing AI is just not wise,” OpenAI’s chief scientist Ilya Sutskever <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23640180/openai-gpt-4-launch-closed-research-ilya-sutskever-interview?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> <em>The Verge</em>.</li><li>In early 2021, Google <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/google-overhauls-ethical-ai-team/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">restructured</a> its responsible AI efforts, placing software engineer Marian Croak at the helm.

So how did they let the alliance between Microsoft and OpenAI integrate the first smash-hit bot into Microsoft products?<br><br><strong>What happened: </strong>Top AI companies brought their conversational agents to market over the past decade-plus amid great fanfare. But Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and Google’s Assistant succumbed to technical limitations and business miscalculations, <em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/15/technology/siri-alexa-google-assistant-artificial-intelligence.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>. Meanwhile, Microsoft launched, retooled, and ultimately killed its entry, Cortana, instead banking on a partnership with OpenAI, whose ChatGPT went on to become a viral sensation.</p><p><strong>Amazon:</strong> Alexa hit the market in 2014. It garnered great enthusiasm as Amazon integrated it into a range of hardware like alarm clocks and kitchen appliances.</p><ul><li>Amazon tried to emulate Apple’s App Store, developing a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/alexa-skills/b?ie=UTF8&node=13727921011&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">skills library</a> that customized Alexa to play simple games or perform tasks like controlling light switches. However, many users found the voice-assistant skills harder to use than mobile apps.</li><li>Amazon had hoped that Alexa would drive ecommerce, but sales didn’t follow.

It drove a spike in sales for a few years, but the novelty wore off as it became mired in technical complexity.</p><ul><li>Siri’s engineers designed the bot to answer questions by querying a colossal list of keywords in multiple languages. Each new feature added words and complexity to the list. Some required engineers to rebuild Siri’s database from scratch.</li><li>The increasingly complex technology made for infrequent updates and made Siri an unsuitable platform for more versatile approaches like ChatGPT.</li></ul><p><strong>Google: </strong>Google debuted Assistant in 2016.

However, this may lead the model to overfit (for instance, the robot may learn to walk effectively only on the terrain used in training). Regularization or normalization enables a model to train multiple times on the same examples without overfitting.</p><p><strong>How it works: </strong>The authors trained a motion-planning model to move a <a href=\"https://m.unitree.com/products/a1/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Unitree A1</a> robot forward on a given terrain using an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">actor-critic</a> algorithm, a reinforcement-learning method in which an actor function learns to take actions that maximize the total return (roughly the sum of all rewards) estimated by a critic function.

It also discouraged the actor from turning sideways.</li><li>After each movement, the critic learned to estimate the expected future reward by minimizing the difference between its expected future reward before the movement and the sum of the actual reward and the expected future reward after the movement.</li><li>The actor-critic algorithm updated the actor’s likelihood of making a particular move based on the size of the critic’s estimated reward.</li><li>The authors applied <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">layer normalization</a> to the critic, enabling it to update 20 times per movement without overfitting. They updated the actor once per movement.</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>The authors trained the model to walk the robot on each of five surfaces (starting from scratch for each surface): flat ground, mulch, lawn, a hiking trail, and a memory foam mattress. The robot learned to walk on each in about 20 minutes, which is roughly equivalent to 20,000 examples. Competing methods use either simulation or more time in the real world. For example, the authors of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14176?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">DayDreamer: World Models for Physical Robot Learning</a> trained the same type of robot to walk on an indoor surface without a simulation, but it took one hour and 3.6 times more examples.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Training on simple features (those with a small number of dimensions, such as robot orientation and velocity) rather than complex features (such as images) reduces the number of examples required to learn a task, and regularizing the model prevents overfitting. This is a simple, general setup to train reinforcement learning models in the real world.</p><p><strong>We're thinking: </strong>Reinforcement learning algorithms are famously data-hungry, which is why much of the progress in the past decade was made in simulated environments. A recipe for training a quadruped rapidly in the real world is a great step forward!</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong><strong>New York City to hire an expert in AI and machine learning</strong></strong><br>The city’s Office of Technology is seeking an expert to identify AI use cases and develop ethical guidelines and best practices for AI applications in the public sector.
