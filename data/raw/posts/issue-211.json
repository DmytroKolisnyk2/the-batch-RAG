It’s hard to know in advance the result of a hyperparameter choice, dataset, or prompt to a large language model (LLM). You just have to try it, get a result, and decide on the next step. Still, understanding how the underlying technology works is very helpful for picking a promising direction. For example, when prompting an LLM, which of the following is more effective?</em><br><br><em>Prompt 1: [Problem/question description] State the answer and then explain your reasoning.</em></p><p><em>Prompt 2: [Problem/question description] Explain your reasoning and then state the answer.</em></p><p><em>These two prompts are nearly identical, and the former matches the wording of many university exams. But the second prompt is much more likely to get an LLM to give you a good answer. Here’s why: An LLM generates output by repeatedly guessing the most likely next word (or token). So if you ask it to start by stating the answer, as in the first prompt, it will take a stab at guessing the answer and then try to justify what might be an incorrect guess. In contrast, prompt 2 directs it to think things through before it reaches a conclusion. This principle also explains the effectiveness of widely discussed prompts such as “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PujnNWbTQYu7iotuZk2ek488_-E2MVLrsuDiglFmigoxshG1Rxnc2G9hMS6Bl4mMeUpFc\" rel=\"noopener\">Let’s think step by step</a>.”</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/08/unnamed--85--1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/unnamed--85--1.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/unnamed--85--1.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/08/unnamed--85--1.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>The image above illustrates this difference using a question with one right answer. But similar considerations apply when asking an LLM to make judgment calls when there is no single right answer; for example, how to phrase an email, what to say to someone who is upset, or the proper department to route a customer email to.</em><br><br><em>That’s why it’s helpful to understand, in depth, how an algorithm works. And that means more than memorizing specific words to include in prompts or studying API calls. These algorithms are complex, and it’s hard to know all the details. Fortunately, there’s no need to. After all, you don’t need to be an expert in GPU compute allocation algorithms to use LLMs. But digging one or two layers deeper than the API documentation to understand how key pieces of the technology work will shape your insights. For example, in the past week, knowing how long-context transformer networks process input prompts and how tokenizers turn an input into tokens shaped how I used them.</em></p><p><em>A deep understanding of technology is especially helpful when the technology is still maturing. Most of us can get a mature technology like GPS to perform well without knowing much about how it works. But LLMs are still an immature technology, and thus your prompts can have non-intuitive effects. Developers who understand the technology in depth are likely to build more effective applications, and build them faster and more easily, than those who don't. Technical depth also helps you to decide when you can’t tell what’s likely to work in advance, and when the best approach is to try a handful of promising prompts, get a result, and keep iterating.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p><em>P.S. Our short course on fine-tuning LLMs is now available! As I <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/tips-for-taking-advantage-of-open-large-language-models/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">wrote</a> last week, many developers are not only prompting LLMs but also fine-tuning them — that is, taking a pretrained model and training it further on their own data. Fine-tuning can deliver superior results, and it can be done relatively inexpensively.

Smaller patches yield higher accuracy but require more computation. A new training method lets AI engineers adjust the tradeoff.</p><p><strong>What's new: </strong>Lucas Beyer and colleagues at Google Research trained <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08013?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PujnNWbTQYu7iotuZk2ek488_-E2MVLrsuDiglFmigoxshG1Rxnc2G9hMS6Bl4mMeUpFc\" rel=\"noopener\">FlexiViT</a>, a vision transformer that allows users to specify the desired patch size.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Vision transformers turn each patch into a token using two matrices of weights, whose values describe the patch’s position and appearance. The dimensions of these matrices depend on patch size. Resizing the matrices enables a transformer to use patches of arbitrary size.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors trained a standard vision transformer on patches of random sizes between 8x8 and 48x48 pixels. They trained it to classify <a href=\"https://github.com/Alibaba-MIIL/ImageNet21K?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PujnNWbTQYu7iotuZk2ek488_-E2MVLrsuDiglFmigoxshG1Rxnc2G9hMS6Bl4mMeUpFc\" rel=\"noopener\">ImageNet-21K</a> (256x256 pixels).</p><ul><li>FlexiVit learned a matrix of size 32x32 to describe each patch’s appearance and a matrix of size 7x7 to describe its position.</li><li>Given an image, FlexiViT resized the matrices according to the desired patch size without otherwise changing the architecture. To accomplish this, the authors developed a complicated method they call pseudo-inverse resize (PI resize).</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors compared FlexiVit to two vanilla vision transformers, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PujnNWbTQYu7iotuZk2ek488_-E2MVLrsuDiglFmigoxshG1Rxnc2G9hMS6Bl4mMeUpFc\" rel=\"noopener\">ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/30</a>, trained on ImageNet-21k using patch sizes of 16x16 and 30x30 respectively. Given patches of various sizes, the vanilla vision transformers’ position and appearance matrices adjusted in the same manner as FlexiViT’s. FlexiViT performed consistently well across patch sizes, while the models trained on a fixed patch size performed well only with that size. For example, given 8x8 patches, FlexiViT achieved 50.2 percent precision; ViT-B/16 achieved 30.5 percent precision, and ViT-B/30 achieved 2.9 percent precision. Given 30x30 patches, FlexiViT achieved 46.6 percent precision, ViT-B/16 achieved 2.4 percent precision, and ViT-B/30 achieved 47.1 percent precision.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The processing power available often depends on the project. This approach makes it possible to train a single vision transformer and tailor its patch size to accommodate the computation budget at inference.</p><p><strong>We're thinking: </strong>Unlike text transformers, for which turning text into a sequence of tokens is relatively straightforward, vision transformers offer many possibilities for turning an image into patches and patches into tokens. It’s exciting to see continued innovation in this area.</p><hr><h2 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h2><p><strong>Supermarket recipe bot produced a dangerous cooking formula</strong><br>New Zealand-based supermarket chain Pak‘nSave introduced a bot to generate recipes from leftover ingredients.
