They amplified and recorded the electric signals transmitted to the nerves when the recipients thought about, say, making a fist, pointing a finger, or rotating a thumb. Then they trained a pair of models to match the signals with the corresponding hand motions.</p><ul><li>A naive Bayes classifier learned to associate nerve signal patterns with common hand shapes.</li><li>The researchers asked the subjects to mimic a virtual thumb as it made back-and-forth and side-to-side motions on a computer screen.

A new method outperforms earlier techniques.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Kihyuk Sohn, David Berthelot, and colleagues at Google Research introduced <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07685?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">FixMatch</a>, which marries two semi-supervised techniques.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> The technique known as <a href=\"http://deeplearning.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pseudo_label_final.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">pseudo labeling</a> uses a trained model’s most confident predictions on unlabeled examples for subsequent supervised training. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04586?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Consistency regularization</a> penalizes a model if its predictions on two versions of the same data point — say, distorted variations on the same image — are dissimilar. Using these techniques in sequence enables a model to generalize insights gained from unlabeled data.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> FixMatch learns from labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously. It learns from a small set of labeled images in typical supervised fashion. It learns from unlabeled images as follows:</p><ul><li>FixMatch modifies unlabeled examples with a simple horizontal or vertical translation, horizontal flip, or other basic translation. The model classifies these weakly augmented images. If its confidence exceeds a user-defined threshold, the predicted class becomes a pseudo label.</li><li>FixMatch generates strongly augmented versions of the pseudo-labeled images by applying either <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13719?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">RandAugment</a> (which samples image augmentations randomly from a predefined set) or <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09785?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">CTAugment</a> (which learns an augmentation strategy as the model trains). Then it applies <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04552?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Cutout</a>, which removes portions randomly.</li><li>The new model learns to classify the strongly augmented images consistently with the pseudo labels of the images they’re based on.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> FixMatch achieved state-of-the-art performance for semi-supervised learning on several benchmarks devised by the researchers. (They removed labels from popular <a href=\"http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">image</a> <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">datasets</a> to create training sets with between four and 400 labels per class.) An <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09785?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">alternative</a> semi-supervised approach performed slightly better on some benchmarks, though it’s not obvious under what circumstances it would be the better choice.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Google Research has been pushing the envelope of semi-supervised learning for image classification with a series of better and better algorithms. FixMatch outperforms its predecessors in the majority of comparisons, and its simplicity is appealing.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Small data techniques promises to open the door to many new applications of AI, and we welcome any progress in this area.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Fawkes20ASPECT.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Examples of original and cloaked portrait photos \" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"secret-identity\">Secret Identity</h2><p>Hoping to keep surveillance capitalists from capitalizing on your face?

All three failed to identify the person in 32 uncloaked validation images — a 100 percent success rate. However, Fawkes had a hard time fooling models that were already familiar with a given face, having already trained on many uncloaked images. The models developed amnesia, though, after ingesting a fake social media account that exclusively contained cloaked (and renamed) photos.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Fawkes isn’t fool-proof.</p><ul><li>The researchers were able to build models that saw through the system’s output. In fact, one such model cut its effectiveness to 65 percent.</li><li>Models trained on photos of a single person in which 15 percent of the pictures were uncloaked were able to identify the person more than half of the time.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> We need ways, whether legal or technical, to enable people to protect their privacy. The U.S. startup Clearview.ai made headlines in January when the <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">New York Times</a></em> reported that its surveillance system, trained on billions of photos scraped from social media sites without permission, was widely used by law enforcement agencies and private businesses. <br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> If this method takes off, face recognition providers likely will find ways to defeat it.

The model reduced the error in expression (average distance between landmark features) to 0.65 from a baseline of 0.84. In a qualitative study, viewers judged generated videos to have been real 65.8 percent of the time — a high score considering that they identified real videos as real 77.2 percent of the time.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Putting new words in a talking head’s mouth is getting easier. While previous approaches often impose prohibitive requirements for training, this method requires only a few minutes of video and audio data.
