It felt like an intrepid band of pioneers taking on the world, and people were eager to help others with advice, an encouraging word, or an introduction.

Well-funded AI companies are piling on parameters at a feverish pace — both to drive higher performance and to flex their muscles — notably in language models, where the internet provides mountains of unlabeled data for unsupervised and semi-supervised pretraining. Since 2018, the parameter-count parade has led through BERT (110 million), GPT-2 (1.5 billion), MegatronLM (8.3 billion), Turing-NLG (17 billion), and GPT-3 (175 billion) to the latest giants.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> The effort to build bigger and bigger models brings its own challenges.

Its self-attention mechanism, which tracks how each element in a sequence relates to every other element, suits it to analyze sequences of not only words but also pixels, video frames, amino acids, seismic waves, and so on. Large language models based on transformers have taken center-stage as examples of an emerging breed of foundation models — models pretrained on a large, unlabeled corpus that can be fine-tuned for specialized tasks on a limited number of labeled examples. The fact that transformers work well in a variety of domains may portend transformer-based foundation models beyond language.<br><br><strong>Where things stand:</strong> The history of deep learning has seen a few ideas that rapidly became pervasive: the ReLU activation function, Adam optimizer, attention mechanism, and now transformers.
