With the easing of the pandemic, it’s fantastic that large conferences are being held in person again!</em></p><p><em>There’s a lot of energy in computer vision right now. As I recall, the natural language processing community was buzzing about transformers a couple of years before ChatGPT revolutionized the field more publicly. At CVPR, I sensed similar excitement in the air with respect to computer vision. It feels like major breakthroughs are coming.</em></p><p><em>It is impossible to summarize hundreds of papers into a single letter, but I want to share some trends that I’m excited about:</em></p><p><em><strong>Vision transformers:</strong> </em>The Batch<em> has covered vision transformers extensively, and it feels like they’re still gaining momentum. The vision transformer <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gVfaxXW-SAT5A7LMebhuJw_HJupeLxSYGl-MAILZ6rgmA1MaeRDCoeMoi0HDsPx54V2UR\" rel=\"noopener\">paper</a> was published in 2020, and already this architecture has become a solid alternative to the convolutional neural network. There are complexities still to be worked out, however. For example, whereas turning a piece of text into a sequence of tokens is relatively straightforward, many decisions need to be made (such as splitting an image into patches, masking, and so on) to turn an image processing problem into a token prediction problem. Many researchers are exploring different alternatives.</em></p><p><em><strong>Image generation:</strong> Algorithms for generating images have been a growing part of CVPR since the emergence of GANs and then diffusion models. This year, I saw a lot of creative work on editing images and giving users more fine-grained control over what such models generate. I also saw a lot of work on generating faces, which is not surprising, since faces interest people.</em></p><p><em><strong>NeRF: </strong>This approach to generating a 3D scene from a set of 2D images has been taking off for a while (and also covered extensively in </em>The Batch<em>). Still, I was surprised at the large number of papers on NeRF. Researchers are working to scale up NeRF to larger scenes, make it run more efficiently, handle moving scenes, work with a smaller number of input images, and so on.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--13--1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--13--1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--13--1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--13--1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Although it was less pronounced than excitement around the topics above, I also noticed increased interest in multimodal models. Specifically, given that a transformer can convert either an image or a piece of text into a sequence of tokens, you can feed both types of tokens into the same transformer model to have it process inputs that include both images and text. Many teams are exploring architectures like this.</em></p><p><em>Lastly, even though the roadmap to self-driving cars has been longer than many people expected, there remains a lot of research in this area. I think the rise of large, pretrained transformers will help kickstart breakthroughs in self-driving.</em></p><p><em>I also spoke at the CVPR conference’s workshop on <a href=\"https://computer-vision-in-the-wild.github.io/cvpr-2023/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gVfaxXW-SAT5A7LMebhuJw_HJupeLxSYGl-MAILZ6rgmA1MaeRDCoeMoi0HDsPx54V2UR\" rel=\"noopener\">Computer Vision in the Wild</a> about Landing AI’s work on making computer vision easy, with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FE88OOUBonQ&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gVfaxXW-SAT5A7LMebhuJw_HJupeLxSYGl-MAILZ6rgmA1MaeRDCoeMoi0HDsPx54V2UR\" rel=\"noopener\">visual prompting</a> as a key component.

All Teslas manufactured since 2019 are equipped with the hardware to support this mode, which can be activated for $15,000 or around $99 per month.</li></ul><p><strong>The crashes:</strong> The NHTSA data is difficult to interpret, since it omits crucial variables such as miles driven and which of Tesla’s two modes was involved in any given crash. Moreover, the earlier and recent crash tallies are difficult to compare due to the difference in their time frames. </p><ul><li>Two-thirds of reported incidents occurred since June 2022, and 17 resulted in fatalities.</li><li>The highest quarterly total roughly coincides with Tesla’s decision in November 2022 to stop restricting Full Self-Driving to Tesla owners whose driving scored highly on certain safety metrics and offer the upgrade to all customers — about 400,000 drivers — regardless of their safety score.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gVfaxXW-SAT5A7LMebhuJw_HJupeLxSYGl-MAILZ6rgmA1MaeRDCoeMoi0HDsPx54V2UR\">Tesla’s own safety report</a>, unlike the NHTSA data, tallies accidents per mile driven, comparing driving with Autopilot engaged, driving without Autopilot, and the U.S. average.

When the defendant appealed to have the case dismissed, Schwartz countered with a brief based on results from a ChatGPT query.</p><ul><li>Schwartz asked the model to find similar cases in which rulings had favored his client’s argument. It cited six cases and offered quotations from the rulings. He asked the model to verify that the cases were real, and it responded with variations of “The case does indeed exist and can be found in legal research databases such as Westlaw and LexisNexis.”</li><li>He and his co-attorneys filed the resulting <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368.21.0.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gVfaxXW-SAT5A7LMebhuJw_HJupeLxSYGl-MAILZ6rgmA1MaeRDCoeMoi0HDsPx54V2UR\" rel=\"noopener\">brief</a> to the court. The defendant’s lawyers, upon reviewing the document, notified the judge that they were unable to find further information about any of the cases.</li><li>When the judge sought clarification, Schwartz <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368.32.1_1.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gVfaxXW-SAT5A7LMebhuJw_HJupeLxSYGl-MAILZ6rgmA1MaeRDCoeMoi0HDsPx54V2UR\" rel=\"noopener\">filed</a> a statement admitting to the error and expressing regret. He had never used ChatGPT before, he said, and did not know it was unreliable.</li><li>Schwartz and his firm’s lead lawyer on the case face an in-person disciplinary hearing on June 8.</li></ul><p><strong>Ripple effects:</strong> In the case’s wake of this case, a federal judge in Texas <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/us-judge-orders-lawyers-sign-ai-pledge-warning-they-make-stuff-up-2023-05-31/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gVfaxXW-SAT5A7LMebhuJw_HJupeLxSYGl-MAILZ6rgmA1MaeRDCoeMoi0HDsPx54V2UR\" rel=\"noopener\">decreed</a> that lawyers in cases before him may use generative AI to write their briefs only if they file paperwork stating that they manually verified the output for accuracy.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Within the AI community, it may be common knowledge that large language models sometimes confidently state falsehoods as though they were true. Among the general public, though, this fact may not be so well understood. Schwartz’s mishap is a painfully public demonstration of what can happen when people trust such models to supply facts.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>People outside the AI community might reasonably assume that the technology is qualified to assist in legal research.  After all, in April, GPT-4, the large language model behind the most powerful version of ChatGPT, reportedly <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/2023/04/19/gpt-4-passes-the-bar-exam-what-that-means-for-artificial-intelligence-tools-in-the-legal-industry/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gVfaxXW-SAT5A7LMebhuJw_HJupeLxSYGl-MAILZ6rgmA1MaeRDCoeMoi0HDsPx54V2UR\" rel=\"noopener\">ranked in the 90th percentile</a> on a U.S. bar exam. (A recent reappraisal <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4441311&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gVfaxXW-SAT5A7LMebhuJw_HJupeLxSYGl-MAILZ6rgmA1MaeRDCoeMoi0HDsPx54V2UR\" rel=\"noopener\">revised</a> GPT-4’s score downward to between the 68th and 48th percentiles.) This goes to show that AI performance on these tests doesn’t necessarily map well to human performance, since any junior law student would know not to invent cases. There’s important work to be done to apply LLMs to legal work. Meanwhile, we urge researchers who are testing LLMs’ ability to meet real-world qualifications to resist hype when reporting their results.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/unnamed--66-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/unnamed--66-.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/unnamed--66-.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/unnamed--66-.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"what-the-brain-sees\">What the Brain Sees</h1><p>A pretrained text-to-image generator enabled researchers to see — roughly — what other people looked at based on brain scans.</p><p><strong>What's new: </strong>Yu Takagi and Shinji Nishimoto developed a <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.18.517004v2.full.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gVfaxXW-SAT5A7LMebhuJw_HJupeLxSYGl-MAILZ6rgmA1MaeRDCoeMoi0HDsPx54V2UR\" rel=\"noopener\">method</a> that uses Stable Diffusion to reconstruct images viewed by test subjects from scans of their brains that were taken while they were looking at the images.</p><p><strong>Diffusion model basics: </strong>During training, a text-to-image generator based on diffusion takes a noisy image and a text description. A model embeds the description, and a diffusion model learns to use the embedding to remove the noise in successive steps. At inference, the system starts with pure noise and a text description, and iteratively removes noise according to the text to generate an image. A variant known as a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&%3Butm_source=hs_email&%3Butm_medium=email&%3B_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF&ref=the-batch-deeplearning-ai&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gVfaxXW-SAT5A7LMebhuJw_HJupeLxSYGl-MAILZ6rgmA1MaeRDCoeMoi0HDsPx54V2UR\">latent diffusion model</a> saves computation by embedding the image as well and removing noise from noisy versions of the embedding instead of a noisy image.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Stable Diffusion, like other latent diffusion text-to-image generators, uses separate embeddings of corresponding images and text descriptions to generate an image. In an analogous way, the region of the human brain that processes input from the eyes can be divided into areas that process the input’s purely sensory and semantic aspects respectively. In brain scans produced by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which depicts cortical blood oxygenation and thus indicates neuron activity, these areas can be embedded separately to substitute for the usual image and text embeddings. Given these embeddings, Stable Diffusion can generate an image similar to what a person was looking at when their brain was scanned.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors trained a simple system to produce input for Stable Diffusion based on fMRI. They trained a separate version of the system for each of four subjects whose brains were scanned as they looked at 10,000 images of <a href=\"http://naturalscenesdataset.org/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gVfaxXW-SAT5A7LMebhuJw_HJupeLxSYGl-MAILZ6rgmA1MaeRDCoeMoi0HDsPx54V2UR\" rel=\"noopener\">natural scenes</a>.</p><ul><li>Given a photo with associated text, Stable Diffusion’s encoders separately embedded the photo and the text.</li><li>The authors trained two linear regression models. One learned to reproduce Stable Diffusion’s image embedding from the part of the fMRI scan that corresponds to the brain’s early visual cortex (which detects the orientation of objects), and the other learned to reproduce Stable Diffusion’s text embedding from the part of the fMRI scan that corresponds to the ventral visual cortex (which decides the meaning of objects).</li><li>At inference, given an fMRI scan, the linear regression models produced image and text embeddings. The authors added noise to the image embedding and fed both embeddings to Stable Diffusion, which generated an image.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors concluded that their approach differed so much from previous <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01769.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gVfaxXW-SAT5A7LMebhuJw_HJupeLxSYGl-MAILZ6rgmA1MaeRDCoeMoi0HDsPx54V2UR\" rel=\"noopener\">work</a> that quantitative comparisons weren’t helpful. Qualitatively, the generated images for all four subjects depict roughly the same scenes as the ground-truth images, though the details differ. For instance, compared to the ground-truth image of an airplane, the generated images appear to show something airplane-shaped but with oddly shaped windows, a cloudier sky, and blurred edges.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Previous efforts to reproduce visual images from brain scans required training a large neural network. In this case, the authors trained a pair of simple linear models and used a large pretrained model to do the heavy lifting.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> The generated images from models trained on brain scans of different subjects showed different details. The authors suggest that this disagreement may have arisen from differences in the subjects’ perceptions or differences in data quality. On the contrary, they may relate to the noise added during image generation.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong>What stands in the way of Nvidia competitors?
