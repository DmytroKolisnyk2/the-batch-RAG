But that process can take hours. The Pentagon’s <a href=\"https://dodcio.defense.gov/About-DoD-CIO/Organization/JAIC/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Joint AI Center</a> hired San Francisco startup CrowdAI to build a model that converts flyover videos into wildfire maps in less than 30 minutes.

A new method spurs them to produce satisfying variations.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Tero Karras and colleagues at Nvidia developed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06676?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Adaptive Discriminator Augmentation</a> (ADA). The process enables GANs to train on small datasets without overfitting, or memorizing the training set, by strategically adding training images that have been augmented via cropping, rotating, color filtering, and so on. The trick is to add augmentations in the right proportion.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> GANs learn to generate the most common types of training examples. Likewise, when trained on augmented training images, they learn to mimic the most common modifications. The authors dynamically controlled the proportion of 18 different modifications to nudge a GAN toward variety without allowing it to fixate on any particular one.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers trained a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">StyleGAN2</a> on subsets of the <a href=\"https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Flickr Faces High Quality</a> (FFHQ) dataset.</p><ul><li>As the model trained, ADA tracked the degree to which it was overfitting. Every fourth minibatch, it estimated the proportion of training data classified as real. The higher the proportion, the higher the indication of overfitting.</li><li>If more than 60 percent of the training data was judged realistic, the system increased the probability that modifications would be applied. Below 60 percent, the system lowered the chance of modifications.</li><li>Each modification was applied separately according to the same probability.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Trained on 2,000 images, ADA achieved a 16.71 Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), a measure of the difference between the non-generated input and generated output in which lower is better. This score is less than a quarter that of the StyleGAN2 baseline after training on 2,000 images (78.58 FID). Furthermore, it’s roughly half the StyleGAN2 baseline using 10,000 images (30.74 FID).<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Gathering tens of thousands of images to train a GAN is a costly chore, but gathering a few thousand is more manageable. By lightening the cost and work involved in assembling training datasets, ADA could widen the utility of GANs in tasks where data is especially scarce.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Anybody else want to use this to generate a new generation of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/every-new-pokemon-sword-shield-galar-region-2019-7?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Pokémon</a>, or is it just us?</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-gif-maker2017.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Series of images showing how Maxine, a media streaming platform, works \" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"data-compression-by-ai\">Data Compression By AI</h3><p>In this work-from-home era, who hasn’t spent a video conference wishing they could read an onscreen document without turning their eyes from the person they’re talking with?

It replaces compression-decompression software with neural networks, using one-tenth the typical H.264 bandwidth. It can also enhance resolution to transmit a sharper picture, alter the video image in useful and creative ways, and deliver additional audio and language services.<br><br>How it works: Maxine is available to video conference providers through major cloud computing vendors.

In addition, the GAN can adjust a speaker’s face position and gaze or transfer keypoint data into an animated avatar that speaks in the user’s voice while mimicking facial expressions. The GAN is trained to work with faces wearing masks, glasses, hats, and headphones.</li><li>Other models manage audio services such as conversational chatbots and noise filtering, as well as language services such as automatic translation and transcription.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The volume of video data on the internet was growing exponentially before the pandemic hit, and since then, video conferencing has exploded. Neural networks can reclaim much of that bandwidth and boost quality in the bargain, scaling up the resolution of pixelated imagery, removing extraneous sounds, and providing expressive animated avatars and informative synthetic backgrounds.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> AI is working wonders for signal processing in both video and audio domains. Streaming is great, but also look for GANs to revolutionize image editing and video production.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/blog/heroes-of-nlp/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-gif-maker2018.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"ezgif.com-gif-maker (18)\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></figure><p>We’re thrilled to present <em><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/blog/heroes-of-nlp/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Heroes of NLP</a></em>, a DeepLearning.AI video series featuring Andrew Ng in conversation with leaders in natural language processing.

Facebook aims to close the gap through a dynamic benchmarking method that keeps humans in the loop.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> <a href=\"https://dynabench.org/about?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Dynabench</a> is an online platform that invites users to try to fool language models. Entries that prompt an incorrect classification will become fodder for next-generation benchmarks and training sets. <br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The platform offers models for question answering, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and natural language inference (given two sentences, decide whether the first implies the second). A large team spanning UNC-Chapel Hill, University College London, and Stanford University built the models.</p><ul><li>Users choose a task and enter a tricky example, and the model renders a classification. For instance, we misled the sentiment analyzer into classifying the following restaurant review as positive: “People who say this pizza is delicious are wonderfully deluded.”</li><li>Alternatively, users can validate examples entered by other people. Validation involves reading entries and flagging whether the model’s classifications are true or false.</li><li>The platform adds misclassified examples to a dataset that researchers will use to retrain the model. Then the cycle begins anew, as users try to stump the updated model.</li><li>Facebook plans to open the platform to all kinds of tasks, inviting model builders to upload new tasks and interested parties to find ways to reveal their weaknesses.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> The new method is plainly experimental. “Will this actually work?” the Dynabench FAQ asks. Answer: “Good question! We won’t know until we try.”<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Facebook’s engineers were inspired by earlier efforts to test AI via humans in an adversarial role including <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00293?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Beat the AI</a>, <a href=\"https://bibinlp.umiacs.umd.edu/sharedtask.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Build It Break It</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/tacl_a_00279?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Trick Me If You Can</a>. <br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> AI exceeds human performance across a range of standardized benchmarks, and Facebook points out that the time between a benchmark’s debut and a model outdoing the human baseline is getting shorter. Yet the technology clearly falls short of human smarts in many everyday tasks. Benchmarks that better reflect human abilities are bound to drive more rapid progress.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>Social media companies are working to build filters to screen out hateful or misleading speech, but adversaries keep finding ways to get through.
