Users can deploy a variety of models in the cloud, on-premises, or via an API.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The new services are based on Nvidia’s pre-existing NeMo toolkit for speech recognition, text-to-speech, and natural language processing.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/nemo-llm-service/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">NeMo LLM</a> provides access to large language models including Megatron 530B, T5, and GPT-3.

But it can’t adapt that response to local conditions; for instance, an environment that includes a sponge but not a mop. Combining a large language model with a model that determines which actions are possible in the current environment makes for a system that can interpret instructions and respond according to the local context.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> SayCan drew from over 550 kitchen-related actions that the authors had trained it to perform using a combination of <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/02/can-robots-follow-instructions-for-new.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">image-based behavioral cloning</a> and reinforcement learning. Actions included picking up, putting down, and rearranging objects; opening and closing drawers; and navigating to various locations.</p><ul><li>Given a command, <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">PaLM</a>, a large language model, considered each action in turn and calculated the probability that it would respond with the description of that action. For instance, if instructed to clean up a spill, PaLM calculated the probability that it would respond, “find a sponge.”</li><li>A reinforcement learning model trained via <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/intro-to-reinforcement-learning-temporal-difference-learning-sarsa-vs-q-learning-8b4184bb4978?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">temporal difference learning</a> learned to estimate the likelihood that the robot would execute the action successfully, accounting for its surroundings. For instance, the robot could pick up a sponge if it saw one, but it couldn’t otherwise. Human judges determined whether the robot had completed a given skill in videos and applied a reward accordingly.</li><li>SayCan multiplied the two probabilities into a single score to determine the most appropriate action. It used a set of convolutional neural networks to decide how to move the robot arm. These networks learned either by copying recorded actions or by reinforcement learning in a simulation.</li><li>After the robot performed an action, SayCan appended the description to the initial PaLM query and repeated the process until it chose the “done” action.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors tested the system by giving the robot 101 commands in a mock kitchen that contained 15 objects such as fruits, drinks, snacks, and a sponge. Human judges determined that the robot planned valid actions 84 percent of the time and carried them out 74 percent of the time. In a real-life kitchen, the robot achieved 81 percent success in planning and 61 percent success in execution.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The dream of a domestic robot has held the public imagination since the dawn of the industrial revolution. But robots favor controlled environments, while households are highly varied and variable. The team took on the challenge by devising a way to choose among 551 skills and 17 objects. These are large numbers, but they may not encompass mundane requests like “find granny’s glasses” and “discard the expired food in the fridge.”</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> This system requires a well-staged environment with a small number of items. We imagine that it could execute the command, “get the chips from the drawer” if the drawer contained only a single bag of chips. But we wonder whether it would do well if the drawer were full and messy. Its success rate in completing tasks suggests that, as interesting as this approach is, we’re still a long way from building a viable robot household assistant.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"http://deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DEEPLEARNING.AI</strong></a></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/09/MLS_Learner_1200x628_A-1_Artboard-1-copy-9--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Learner Robert Wydler quote about the DeepLearning.ai Machine Learning Specialization\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"628\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/MLS_Learner_1200x628_A-1_Artboard-1-copy-9--1-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/MLS_Learner_1200x628_A-1_Artboard-1-copy-9--1-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/09/MLS_Learner_1200x628_A-1_Artboard-1-copy-9--1-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Robert Wydler was always drawn to AI.

Unisys offers a system called <a href=\"https://stealthsecurity.unisys.com/stealth-identity?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Stealth(identity)</a> that scans a person’s face, irises, voice, and fingerprints. It places faces of people it has identified in a registry. Then, when it encounters any face, it scans the registry for a match.</li><li>The new system scans faces and irises simultaneously and does not require fingerprinting. It will process individuals faster and improve categorization of people coming and going, according to a prison representative.</li><li>16 correctional centers will complete installation in early 2023 at a total cost of $12.8 million in Australian dollars. Corrective Services NSW said it expects the system to reduce operational expenses by 12 percent.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Samantha Floreani of Digital Rights Watch <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxngmx/facial-recognition-will-be-used-to-boost-profits-in-some-australian-prisons?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">raised concerns</a> that face recognition may exacerbate biases in the Australian corrective system, which incarcerates indigenous people disproportionately. Additionally, Floreani said that contracting to Unisys, a U.S.-based firm, raises questions about whether personal data on Australians will be transferred to another country and whether the data will be secure and handled properly. The Australian public, too, is wary. A 2021 <a href=\"https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/majority-of-australians-support-limits-on-artificial-intelligence-and-facial-recognition-technology-in-australia/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">poll</a> found that 55 percent of Australians supported a moratorium on face recognition until stronger safeguards are in place.<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> England and Wales <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47461035?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">tested</a> face recognition for screening prison visitors in 2019, mostly in an effort to crack down on smuggling of drugs into prisons. In the United States, the federal Justice Department has funded several <a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/10_00.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">initiatives</a> to apply face recognition. The U.S. Marshals Service, which handles fugitive investigations, is <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/24/1032967/us-government-agencies-plan-to-increase-their-use-of-facial-recognition-technology/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">developing</a> a face recognition system to aid in transporting prisoners.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The flow of visitors, contractors, and prisoners into and out of correctional facilities creates opportunities for security breaches. Face recognition promises to help manage this traffic more safely. However, the technology, which is relatively new, largely unregulated, and developing rapidly, brings with it potential for abuse, mission creep, and other adverse consequences, especially in a high-stakes field like criminal justice.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Surveillance has always been an inextricable part of incarceration, but it shouldn’t encroach on the rights of prisoners or the people who guard, visit, and provide services to them. More optimistically, if technology can generate indelible, auditable records of the activities of both guards and prisoners, it can help protect against abuses and address them when they occur.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/09/DEITv2-compressed--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Animation showing 3 main types of data augmentation and random cropping of a picture\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/09/DEITv2-compressed--1-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"cookbook-for-vision-transformers\">Cookbook for Vision Transformers</h1><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) are overtaking convolutional neural networks (CNN) in many vision tasks, but procedures for training them are still tailored for CNNs. New research investigated how various training ingredients affect ViT performance.</p><p><strong>What's new:</strong> Hugo Touvron and colleagues at Meta and Sorbonne University formulated a new recipe for training ViTs. They call their third-generation approach <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07118?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Data Efficient Image Transformers</a> (DeiT III).</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> The CNN and transformer architectures differ. For instance, when processing an image, a CNN works on one group of pixels at a time, while a transformer processes all pixels simultaneously. Moreover, while the computational cost of a CNN scales proportionally to input size, a transformer’s self-attention mechanism requires dramatically more processing as input size increases. Training recipes that take these differences — and other, less obvious ones — into account should impart better performance.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors pretrained <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ViTs</a> to classify images in ImageNet using various combinations of training data, data augmentation, and regularization. (They also experimented with variables such as weight decay, dropout, and type of optimizer, for which they didn’t describe results in detail.) They fine-tuned and tested on ImageNet.</p><ul><li>The authors pretrained the transformers on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10972?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ImageNet-21K</a> using lower image resolutions, such as 192x192 pixels, before fine-tuning on full-res 224x224-pixel images. Pretraining transformers on lower-res versions is faster and less memory-intensive and has been <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06423?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">shown</a> to result in better classification of full-res images.</li><li>ImageNet-21K includes roughly 10 times as many images as the more common ImageNet. The larger dataset makes augmenting data via random cropping unnecessary to prevent overfitting. Instead, they used a cropping procedure that was more likely to retain an image’s subject. First, they resized training examples so their smaller dimension matched the training resolution (say, from 224x448 to 192x384). Then they cropped the larger dimension to form a square (192x192) with a random offset.</li><li>The authors altered the colors of training examples by blurring, grayscaling, or solarizing (that is, inverting colors above a certain intensity). They also randomly changed brightness, contrast, and saturation. Less consistent color information may have forced the transformers — which are less sensitive than CNNs to object outlines — to focus more on shapes.</li><li>They used two regularization schemes. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09382?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Stochastic depth</a> forces individual layers to play a greater role in the output by skipping layers at random during training. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17239?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">LayerScale</a> achieves a similar end by multiplying layer outputs by small, learnable weights. Because a transformer’s residual connections connect every other layer, this scaling enables the network to begin learning with a small number of layers and add more as training progresses. The gradual accumulation helps it continue to learn despite having large numbers of layers, which can impede convergence.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors’ approach substantially improved ViT performance. An 86 million-parameter ViT-B pretrained on ImageNet-21K and fine-tuned on ImageNet using the full recipe achieved 85.7 percent accuracy. Their cropping technique alone yielded 84.8 percent accuracy. In contrast, the same architecture trained on the same datasets using full-resolution examples augmented via <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13719v2?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">RandAugment</a> achieved 84.6 percent accuracy.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Deep learning is evolving at a breakneck pace, and familiar hyperparameter choices may no longer be the most productive. This work is an early step toward updating for the transformer era recipes that were developed when CNNs ruled computer vision.</p><p><strong>We're thinking:</strong> The transformer architecture’s hunger for data makes it especially important to reconsider habits around data-related training procedures like augmentation and regularization.</p>","comment_id":"6334ad4ae11ff8003db97c6b","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-28-at-11.55.14-AM-copy.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-09-28T13:23:38.000-07:00","updated_at":"2023-02-06T13:12:04.000-08:00","published_at":"2022-09-28T14:38:51.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"The Batch - AI News & Insights.
