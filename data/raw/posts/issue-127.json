While taking online courses in technical topics is an important step, being an AI professional requires more than technical skills. Lately I’ve been thinking about how to do more to support all of you who are looking to build a career in AI.</em><br><br><em>Considering individuals at a variety of stages in their careers, what are some of the keys to success?</em></p><ul><li><em><strong>Technical skills.</strong> When learning a new skill, taking an online course or reading a textbook — in which an expert presents important concepts into an easy-to-digest format — is one of the most efficient paths forward.</em></li><li><em><strong>Practical experience.</strong> After gaining a skill, it’s necessary to practice it — and learn tricks of the trade — by applying that skill to significant projects. Machine learning models that perform well in the lab can run into trouble in the real world. Practical project experience remains an important component in overcoming such problems.</em></li><li><em><strong>Project selection.</strong> Choosing projects to work on is one of the hardest skills in AI. We can only work on so many projects at a time, and scoping ones that are both feasible and valuable — so they have a good chance of achieving meaningful success — is an important step that has to be done repeatedly in the course of a career.</em></li><li><em><strong>Teamwork.</strong> When we tackle large projects, we succeed better by working in teams than individually. The ability to collaborate with, influence, and be influenced by others is critical. This includes both interpersonal and communication skills.

As an introvert, having to go to a party to smile and shake as many hands as possible is an activity that borders on horrific. I’d much rather stay home and read a book. Nonetheless, I’m fortunate to have found many genuine friends in AI; people I would gladly go to bat for and who I count on as well. No person is an island, and having a strong professional network can help propel you forward in the moments when you need help or advice.</em></li><li><em><strong>Job search.</strong> Of all the steps in building a career, this one tends to receive the most attention. Unfortunately, I’ve found a lot of bad advice about this on the internet. (For example, many articles seem to urge taking an adversarial attitude toward potential employers, which I don’t think is helpful). Although it may seem like finding a job is the ultimate goal, it’s just one small step in the long journey of a career.</em></li><li><em><strong>Personal discipline.</strong> Few people will know if you spend your weekends learning or binge watching TV (unless you tell them on social media!), but they will notice the difference over time. Many successful people develop good habits in eating, exercise, sleep, personal relationships, work, learning, and self-care. Such habits help them move forward while staying healthy.</em></li><li><em><strong>Altruism.</strong> I find that individuals who aim to lift others during every step of their own journey often achieve better outcomes for themselves. How can we help others even as we build an exciting career for ourselves?</em></li></ul><p><em>Each of these items is a complex subject worthy of an entire book. I will continue to think on how we can work collectively to support everyone’s career goals. Meanwhile, I would like to hear your thoughts as well. What am I missing?

Adam uses an estimate of the change in the gradient of each weight over time, which can occupy as much as 50 percent of the memory required during training. However, at any given time, the optimizer needs only the estimates pertinent to the weights it’s currently processing. The remaining part can be quantized temporarily — that is, the numbers can be converted into fewer bits — to take up less memory.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors used block-wise quantization, which means that gradient statistics were split into blocks and each block was quantized independently.</p><ul><li>During training, an optimizer updated parameters in groups (for example, the group of weights in a neural network’s first layer). After it updated the weights of one group, it quantized the group’s gradient statistics, stored them, and updated the next group.</li><li>To perform quantization, the algorithm split the gradient statistics of one group into blocks of 2,048 numbers. For each block, it recorded the maximum absolute value, then divided the block’s elements using that value, so the maximum absolute value became 1. For each divided element, it looked up the closest 8-bit value, then stored the index (0...255) of that value.</li><li>When it returned to a particular group, it dequantized the gradient statistics for that group by reversing the steps above. Then it performed another update and quantized the statistics again.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors used their method on a few language tasks including <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02891?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--nehcWFRjoOUBOMOFxCLZLlgPuhwgVFurIubizov0suhXRrtJrC-d6lqsGlm3upPZ-tWMw\" rel=\"noopener\">machine translation</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07461?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--nehcWFRjoOUBOMOFxCLZLlgPuhwgVFurIubizov0suhXRrtJrC-d6lqsGlm3upPZ-tWMw\" rel=\"noopener\">GLUE</a>. Models trained on the 8-bit version of Adam achieved BLEU and accuracy scores on those tasks, respectively, nearly identical to those achieved by the 32-bit version. Using 8-bit Adam, authors fine-tuned a 1.5 billion-parameter GPT-2-large on an Nvidia V100 GPU with 24GB of memory. Using the 32-bit Adam optimizer, the hardware maxed out on a 762-million parameter GPT-2-medium.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Using an 8-bit optimizer makes it possible to train bigger models —in this work, roughly twice as big — on a given hardware configuration. For instance, now we can train Roberta-large — which is 1 percent to 5 percent more accurate than Roberta, according to the original paper — within the previous memory requirement for the smaller version.<br><br><strong>We're thinking:</strong> Details like how much memory an optimizer uses may not seem worthy of attention when you’re designing and training a model — but, given the memory and processing requirements of deep learning models, sometimes they can have a big impact.</p>","comment_id":"61df3089e05370003b06b750","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-5.43.32-PM-copy.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-01-12T11:48:25.000-08:00","updated_at":"2022-10-05T15:04:49.000-07:00","published_at":"2022-01-12T11:51:24.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"AI continues to create numerous exciting career opportunities, and I know that many of you aim to develop a career in the field.
