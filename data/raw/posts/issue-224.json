Strong alignment within the team could lead to increased effectiveness. That would be great for AI innovation, the company, and its customers and users.</em></li><li><em>A few media outlets, notably The Information and Bloomberg, demonstrated a strong ability to get scoops about what was happening. Many are saying that OpenAI will face increased scrutiny in the future.</em></li><li><em>Bret Taylor (who helped Twitter navigate its sale to Elon Musk) and Larry Summers (former United States Secretary of the Treasury and Harvard president) are strong additions to the board. OpenAI has a small but efficient lobbying team that has been highly influential on global AI regulation, and Summers’ background makes him a valuable addition to such efforts. I look forward to a more diverse board as its membership grows.</em></li><li><em>In recent days, I heard from multiple businesses that are looking for alternatives to the OpenAI API to ensure their own continuity of operations. The quick resolution of the crisis has stemmed much of the damage, but the fact that some customers are looking at backup options will be hard to reverse.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>The failure of OpenAI’s unusual for-profit/nonprofit corporate structure is glaring. Investors and donors will be more hesitant to fund organizations with novel structures (which often come with passionate arguments — which fell apart in the case of OpenAI — about why they’re better). In most companies, board oversight over the CEO’s performance would be good governance, and for a fired CEO to rally employees against the board and get their job back would be a sign of awful governance. But OpenAI’s previous board nearly destroyed so much value, for no apparent reason, that I’m glad employees helped reverse the decision. The reconstituted board has its work cut out for it to put in place robust governance.</em></li></ul><p><em>ChatGPT was released on November 30, 2022. It is amazing how much has happened at OpenAI — and in the AI world — in less than one year! Brief stretches of chaos may be the price of moving fast. Nonetheless, I think moving fast (but responsibly) is better than going slowly.&nbsp;<br><br>I hope all employees everywhere will come away from this episode feeling empowered to speak up and make things better. Let’s keep building AI, exercise wisdom and foresight, and learn what lessons we can about corporate governance. It’s probably too much to hope that there won't be additional bumps in the road ahead for AI, but I remain optimistic about all the good we can do.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/unnamed--74-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"677\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/unnamed--74-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/unnamed--74-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/unnamed--74-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"the-ceo-is-out-in\">The CEO Is&nbsp;<s>Out</s>&nbsp;In</h1><p>OpenAI abruptly fired and rehired its CEO Sam Altman, capping five days of chaos within the company.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;On Friday, the OpenAI board of directors — whose membership since has changed —&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVp5ZM8dF5__VTCm7Q7pxQnCW8mS6hr569sRgN6B8Nrj3qgyTW7Y8-PT6lZ3kWW4-6YjN49c0VxV9NKPp4MQkx5W5jdCkm7tb0nGW7ct1p-43C_Q3W6SLzqg1PMbcwW8fmXzT8Y0gJ-W1JvslX3270vhW16mqPq4YFlT5Mj55KgMZjYhW1DrMpY4qTcLWN8B_rSMjsJnDW14zRh45ll3yxN63h4l1B-7_pW4_ZdsG3-Q5q6W4VHk7743cnjKW43pVfJ4B-VtXV3KxCH5B1sNhW4RkftP3MYQ5SW7Ysd2Q2k9Q2KW5bkw168vQ-JXW4VFHQc4YTKyNW40px8V3nzSc3W35X1D93jRVNtW7LXQ2k6NBQbrW9gxMSF6BWS-MW90dDcH49kW43f7mn2XY04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ousted</a>&nbsp;CEO and co-founder Sam Altman from his leadership position and his seat on the board.

Here’s who has passed through the revolving door.</p><ul><li>CEO Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI in 2015, while he was president of startup accelerator YCombinator, and became chief executive in 2019. He reoriented the company from research to products, gaining widespread recognition for the GPT series of large language models and the 2022 launch of ChatGPT. Lately he has invested in and raised money for other ventures including the biometric identity service Worldcoin, fusion-energy reactor builder Helion Energy, Humane’s AI Pin, and a chip company that would compete with Nvidia.&nbsp;</li><li>Mira Murati served as interim CEO November 17 through November 19. She joined OpenAI in 2018 after working on AI products at Tesla and Leap Motion. She became OpenAI’s senior vice president of research, product, and partnerships in 2020 and CTO in 2022, leading development of ChatGPT, DALL·E, and other models. She championed the effort to reinstate Altman and Brockman during her stint as interim CEO.</li><li>Emmett Shear was interim CEO November 19 through November 21. He was part of YCombinator’s initial cohort in 2005, co-founded the company that became Twitch in 2007, and sold it to Amazon for nearly $1 billion in 2014. He departed Twitch in early 2023. During his brief tenure at OpenAI, Shear threatened to resign unless the board provided evidence of Altman’s wrongdoing. Upon Altman’s return, he&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVp5ZM8dF5__VTCm7Q7pxQnCW8mS6hr569sRgN6B8Nr03qgyTW7lCdLW6lZ3p0W8NCs-K7WTpm9W6NVyfX5zrYbwW3h6Sg711vknVW3hxS3R2HM38HV6bG3Z78jyzCW3cGZKF6xDJydW36pCK93kBSGfW3JWwLc6jGRm5W5jSw6j4hJ-pGW69qbRG5LgW7bW3kP_yG7wPtjyW7sQHNr23w93VW53bTTD945JKVW4PrDmN1xzf8_W1nLxq94dDtkLVjyGVk7pC1zqN6YgNtYmD_MHW8sRLJ431tw8VVhv5R41Bs4VcW104Yv23sHCSYW6sfHMv1gC3ZTW3SGbmq1Z-NCtW8Hkb-X8NxJSsW5rt43l89fw_cf6GD7d-04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>&nbsp;on X, “I am deeply pleased by this result.”</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;At a moment when AI is undergoing rapid development and deepening division over the role of regulation, the chaos at OpenAI highlights the importance of strong corporate governance and an experienced board of directors that has a range of relevant experience and strong alignment with the company’s mission. It’s highly unusual for directors to fire a chief executive without arranging an orderly succession, coordinating with key investors, and preparing the market for changes. Chaos at the company opened competitive opportunities for rivals and threatened to destabilize thousands of companies that depend on OpenAI services. Although Altman’s return presumably restores the company’s stability, it will bear lingering questions and greater scrutiny going forward.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;There’s nothing normal about goings on at OpenAI.

As a transformer processes each token (often a word or pixel) in an input sequence, it concurrently processes — or “attends” to — every other token in the sequence. Attention is calculated by multiplying two large matrices of weights before passing the resulting matrix through a soft​​max function. The softmax function normalizes the matrix values to a probability distribution, bringing higher values closer to 1 and lower values near 0. This enables the transformer, when encoding a token, to use relevant tokens and ignore irrelevant tokens.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(Modified) attention is all you need:</strong>&nbsp;The authors identify three approaches to accelerating transformers. Two of them optimize the attention mechanism and the third optimizes other parts of the architecture.</p><ul><li><strong>Sparse attention.&nbsp;</strong>These approaches simplify the attention calculation by using a subset of weights and setting the rest to 0. They mix and match three general patterns in which the position of a given token in a sequence determines how it attends to other tokens: (i) a token attends to all other tokens, (ii) a token attends only to directly neighboring tokens, or (iii) a token attends to a random selection of tokens.
