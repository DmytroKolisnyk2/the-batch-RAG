Last week’s shocking attempt to assassinate former President Trump was a reminder that democracy is fragile.</p><p>Democracy lets citizens argue with each other via words and votes. While imperfect, it is a powerful force for making sure that people are governed by leaders of their own choosing, and that these leaders are accountable to making people better off.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s why attempts to disrupt the democratic process, such as assassinating a political candidate or attempting to disrupt a peaceful handover of power to a newly elected government, are despicable: They attack a fundamental mechanism for giving everyone a chance to have a say in who governs. I denounce all political violence and grieve for Corey Comperatore, who was killed in the assassination attempt, and for his family. I hope for a quick recovery for former President Trump and the bystanders who were injured. I also hope we can put more resources into strengthening the mechanisms of democracy.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, I wonder what role AI can play in preserving democracy.&nbsp;</p><p>Technology can have positive or negative impacts on specific mechanisms of democracy. For instance, data analysis can help citizens and reporters discover facts. Micro-targeting of political ads and social media can increase polarization, while social media can also provide useful information to voters.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--72--1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/unnamed--72--1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/unnamed--72--1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--72--1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>But zooming out to a macro view,</p><ul><li>Concentration of power, which is enhanced by concentration of access to technology, tends to make a subset of society more powerful at the expense of the whole and thus weakens democracy. For example, if only major political parties have the resources to place highly targeted voter ads, it’s hard for new parties to break in.</li><li>However, widespread access to new technologies tends to make everyone more powerful, and thus strengthens democracy. For example, widespread access to smartphones, web search, and now large language model chatbots broadens access to information and lets each individual do more. Thus, I believe spreading new technology as far and wide as possible is an important way to strengthen democracy.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>I’m glad last week’s assassination attempt failed, just as I’m glad the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol failed. Both events were close calls and resulted in tragic loss of human life. Looking into the future, in addition to specific applications that strengthen elements of democracy, I hope we keep on promoting widespread access to technology. This will enhance fairness and the ability of individuals to vote wisely. That’s why democratizing access to technology will help democracy itself.</p><p>Keep learning!</p><p>Andrew&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-for-software-development?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-07-17T111109.125.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-07-17T111109.125.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-07-17T111109.125.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-07-17T111109.125.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-07-17T111109.125.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Enhance your software-development workflow with our new course, “Generative AI for Software Development.” Learn how to use generative AI tools to boost efficiency, improve code quality, and collaborate creatively.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-for-software-development?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pre-enroll today and be the first to join when the course goes live</a></p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--73-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/unnamed--73-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/unnamed--73-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--73-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"copyright-claim-fails-in-github-case\">Copyright Claim Fails in GitHub Case</h1><p>A judge rejected key claims in a lawsuit by developers against GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI, the first decision in a series of court actions related to generative AI.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s new</strong>: A U.S. federal judge&nbsp;<a href=\"https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/07/08/github_copilot_dismiss.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zO8uuNh9EbBkFJAokTXKxTujRKaiq-z0B9iiyi5sH_gAfph9L318PWgvBzeY82HykJysg\" rel=\"noopener\">dismissed</a>&nbsp;claims of copyright infringement and unfair profit in a class-action lawsuit that targeted GitHub Copilot and the OpenAI Codex language-to-code model that underpins it.</p><p><strong>The case:</strong>&nbsp;In November 2022, programmer Matthew Butterick and the Joseph Saveri Law Firm&nbsp;<a href=\"https://githubcopilotlitigation.com/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zO8uuNh9EbBkFJAokTXKxTujRKaiq-z0B9iiyi5sH_gAfph9L318PWgvBzeY82HykJysg\" rel=\"noopener\">filed</a>&nbsp;the lawsuit in U.S. federal court. The plaintiffs claimed that GitHub Copilot had generated unauthorized copies of open-source code hosted on GitHub, which OpenAI Codex used as training data.

He dismissed this copyright claim with prejudice, meaning that the plaintiffs can’t refile it.</li><li>The judge also dismissed a claim that GitHub illicitly profited from coders’ work by charging money for access to GitHub Copilot. To claim unjust enrichment under California law, plaintiffs must show that the defendant enriched itself through “mistake, fraud, coercion, or request.” The judge ruled that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate this.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong>&nbsp;The lawsuit is reduced, but it isn’t finished. A breach-of-contract claim remains. The plaintiffs aim to show that OpenAI and GitHub used open-source code without providing proper attribution and thus violated open-source licenses.

A verdict could determine how code can be used and how developers can use generative AI in their work. However, it has broader implications. (Note: We are not lawyers and we do not provide legal advice.) This dismissal is not a final verdict, but it supports the view that AI developers may have a broad right to use data for training models even if that data is protected by copyright.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Broadly speaking, we would like AI to be allowed to do with data, including open source code, anything that humans can legally and ethically do, including study and learn. We hope the judge’s decision gives AI developers further clarity on how they can use training data, and we hope it establishes that it’s ethical to use code-completion tools trained on open-source code.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/unnamed---2024-07-17T135649.502.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/unnamed---2024-07-17T135649.502.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/unnamed---2024-07-17T135649.502.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/unnamed---2024-07-17T135649.502.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"how-open-are-open-models\">How Open Are Open Models?</h1><p>The word “open” can mean many things with respect to AI.

It can also lubricate business insofar as it enables developers to sell products built upon fully open software. And it has growing regulatory implications. For example, the European Union’s AI Act regulates models that are released under an open source license less strictly than closed models. All these factors raise the stakes for clear, consistent definitions. The authors’ framework offers clear, detailed guidelines for developers — and policymakers — in search of clarity.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;We’re grateful to AI developers who open their work to any degree, and we especially appreciate fully open availability, documentation, and access.

But there are tradeoffs: Midjourney v6 takes 85.3 seconds on average to generate an image, more than four times longer than DALL·E 3 HD and more than 13 times longer than Stable Diffusion 3. Midjourney v6 costs $66 per 1,000 images (an estimate by Artificial Analysis based on Midjourney’s policies, since the model doesn’t offer per-image pricing), nearly equal to Stable Diffusion 3 ($65), less than DALL·E 3 HD ($80), and significantly more than Playground v2.5 ($5.13 per 1,000 images via the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://replicate.com/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zO8uuNh9EbBkFJAokTXKxTujRKaiq-z0B9iiyi5sH_gAfph9L318PWgvBzeY82HykJysg\" rel=\"noopener\">Replicate</a>&nbsp;API).</p><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong>&nbsp;The Text to Image Arena is a text-to-image counterpart of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/chatbot-arena-compares-chatbots-side-by-side?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zO8uuNh9EbBkFJAokTXKxTujRKaiq-z0B9iiyi5sH_gAfph9L318PWgvBzeY82HykJysg\" rel=\"noopener\">LMSys Chatbot Arena</a>, which lets users write a prompt, feed it to two large language models, and pick the winner.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://imgsys.org/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zO8uuNh9EbBkFJAokTXKxTujRKaiq-z0B9iiyi5sH_gAfph9L318PWgvBzeY82HykJysg\" rel=\"noopener\">imgsys</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/TIGER-Lab/GenAI-Arena?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zO8uuNh9EbBkFJAokTXKxTujRKaiq-z0B9iiyi5sH_gAfph9L318PWgvBzeY82HykJysg\" rel=\"noopener\">Gen-AI Arena</a>&nbsp;similarly let users choose between images generated by different models from the same prompt (Gen-AI Arena lets users write their own).

Aggregating user preferences is a sensible way to measure it. However, individual tastes and applications differ, which makes personalized leaderboards useful as well.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;The user interface for some image generators implicitly asks users to judge images. For example, Midjourney defaults to generating four images and asks users which they want to render at higher resolution. This can give the image generator valuable feedback about which image users like. Perhaps data gathered by an arena could feed an algorithm like reinforcement learning from human feedback to help generators learn to produce output that people prefer.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/unnamed---2024-07-17T135854.645.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/unnamed---2024-07-17T135854.645.png 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"hallucination-detector\">Hallucination Detector</h1><p>Large language models can produce output that’s convincing but false.

The higher the entropy, the more likely the output was hallucinated. However, this approach is flawed: Even if the model mostly generates outputs with a uniform meaning, the entropy of the outputs can still be high, since the same meaning can be phrased in many different ways. A better approach is to calculate entropy based on the distribution of generated meanings instead of generated sequences of words. Given a particular input, the more likely a model is to respond by generating outputs with a variety of meanings, the more likely that a response to that input is a hallucination.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors generated answers to five&nbsp;<a href=\"http://participants-area.bioasq.org/datasets/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zO8uuNh9EbBkFJAokTXKxTujRKaiq-z0B9iiyi5sH_gAfph9L318PWgvBzeY82HykJysg\" rel=\"noopener\">open-ended</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zO8uuNh9EbBkFJAokTXKxTujRKaiq-z0B9iiyi5sH_gAfph9L318PWgvBzeY82HykJysg\" rel=\"noopener\">question</a>-<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03551?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zO8uuNh9EbBkFJAokTXKxTujRKaiq-z0B9iiyi5sH_gAfph9L318PWgvBzeY82HykJysg\" rel=\"noopener\">and</a>-<a href=\"https://github.com/arkilpatel/SVAMP?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zO8uuNh9EbBkFJAokTXKxTujRKaiq-z0B9iiyi5sH_gAfph9L318PWgvBzeY82HykJysg\" rel=\"noopener\">answer</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zO8uuNh9EbBkFJAokTXKxTujRKaiq-z0B9iiyi5sH_gAfph9L318PWgvBzeY82HykJysg\" rel=\"noopener\">datasets</a>&nbsp;using various sizes of Falcon, LLaMA 2-chat, and Mistral.

For example, given the prompt, “Are the deadlines established by the bankruptcy rules for objecting to discharge jurisdictional,” one model cited a nonexistent rule: “[A] paragraph from the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, Rule 4007 states that the deadlines set by bankruptcy rules governing the filing of dischargeability complaints are jurisdictional.”<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Effective detection of hallucinations not only fosters trust in users — and consequently rising adoption — but also enables researchers to determine common circumstances in which hallucinations occur, helping them to address the problem in future models.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:&nbsp;</strong>Researchers are exploring various approaches to mitigate LLM hallucinations in trained models.
