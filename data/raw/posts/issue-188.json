If it passed uneventfully from your point of view, good for you! Many companies worked nonstop through the weekend scrambling to preserve funds so they could pay their employees.</em></p><p><em>Numerous tech startups and small businesses bank at SVB, and many are among the business pioneers who are bringing AI to market. For example, when AI Fund, which I lead, works with entrepreneurs to build new companies, we used to help them set up accounts with SVB.</em></p><p><em>Last Wednesday, SVB announced a $1.8 billion loss. The next morning, rumors began circulating via text, email, and Slack about a bank run in which customers were withdrawing funds </em>en masse<em>. When this happens, depositors can lose money they’ve saved beyond the $250,000 limit the FDIC (a U.S. government agency) guarantees. Without access to their money, companies can’t pay employees who are counting on a paycheck to cover expenses. A permanent loss of funds would lead to numerous layoffs and company shutdowns.</em></p><p><em>While navigating the collapse of SVB, I was fortunate to be able to call on friends and allies. Several CEOs of AI Fund portfolio companies share a Slack channel and have pre-existing relationships, so none of us felt alone. We were able to share information, make introductions to new banks, and lean in to help each other. Over the weekend, the AI Fund team went to many CEOs and pledged funds from AI Fund’s management company to make sure they could cover their payrolls.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/unnamed--29--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/unnamed--29--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/unnamed--29--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/unnamed--29--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>I also saw the best of the AI and tech worlds last week beyond the AI Fund ecosystem.

The company showed statistics and examples designed to demonstrate that the new model outstrips its predecessors in its language comprehension as well as its ability to adopt a desired style and tone and stay within bounds imposed by its designers. OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman showed off some of its capabilities in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=outcGtbnMuQ&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">livestream</a> that accompanied the launch.<br><br><strong>How to get access:</strong> Text input/output is available via <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ChatGPT Plus</a>, which costs $20 monthly, with image input to come. An API is forthcoming, and you can join the waitlist <a href=\"https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>. <br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> OpenAI didn’t share many details, citing concerns about safety and competition. Like earlier GPT models, <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">GPT-4</a> is based on the transformer architecture and trained to predict the next token on a mix of public and private datasets. It was fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback and engineered prompts.</p><ul><li>OpenAI is keeping mum about the precise architecture (including size), datasets, training procedure, and processing requirements.</li><li>GPT-4 processes 32,000 tokens at a time internally, Brockman said — an order of magnitude more than estimates of ChatGPT’s token count — which enables it to work with longer texts than previous large language models.</li><li>The model accepts image inputs including pages of text, photos, diagrams, and screenshots. (This capability isn’t yet publicly available because the company is still working to speed it up, Brockman said.) In one example, GPT-4 explained the humor in a photo of an iPhone whose sleek Lightning port had been adapted to accommodate a hulking VGA connector.</li><li>A new type of input called a system message instructs the model on the style, tone, and verbosity to use in subsequent interactions. For example, a system message can condition the model to respond in the style of Socrates, encouraging users to arrive at their own answers through critical thinking.</li><li>The company offers a new framework, OpenAI Evals, for creating and running benchmarks. It invites everyone to help test the model.</li></ul><p><strong>How it performs: </strong>GPT-4 aced a variety of AI benchmarks as well as simulated versions of tests designed for humans.</p><ul><li>GPT-4 outperformed the state of the art on MMLU multiple-choice question answering, HellaSwag common sense reasoning, AI2 grade-school multiple-choice science question answering, WinoGrande common-sense reasoning, HumanEval Python coding, and DROP reading comprehension and arithmetic.</li><li>It exceeded GPT-3.5, Chinchilla, and PaLM English-language performance in 24 languages from Afrikaans to Welsh.<br>The model met or exceeded the state of the art in several vision benchmarks in TextVQA reading text in images, ChartQA, AI2 Diagram, DocVQA, Infographic VQA, and TVQA.</li><li>GPT-4 achieved between 80 and 100 percent on simulated human tests including the Uniform Bar Exam, LSAT, SAT, and advanced placement tests in biology, psychology, microeconomics, and statistics.</li><li>GPT-4 jumps its guardrails when asked about disallowed topics like how to obtain dangerous substances roughly 1 percent of the time, while GPT-3.5 does so around 5 percent of the time. Similarly, GPT-4 misbehaves when asked about sensitive topics such as self-harm around 23 percent of the time, while GPT-3.5 does so around 42 percent of the time.</li></ul><p><strong>Where it works: </strong>Several companies are already using GPT-4.</p><ul><li>OpenAI itself has been using the model for content moderation, sales, customer support, and coding.</li><li>The updated Microsoft Bing search, which launched last month, is <a href=\"https://blogs.bing.com/search/march_2023/Confirmed-the-new-Bing-runs-on-OpenAI%E2%80%99s-GPT-4?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">based</a> on GPT-4.</li><li><a href=\"https://openai.com/customer-stories/stripe?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Stripe</a> uses GPT-4 to scan and write summaries of business websites.</li><li>Paid subscribers to Duolingo can learn languages by <a href=\"https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">conversing</a> with GPT-4.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> OpenAI doesn’t mince words about the new model’s potential to wreak havoc: “While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios . . . GPT-4's capabilities and limitations create significant and novel safety challenges.” While the model outperformed its predecessors in internal adversarial evaluations of factual correctness, like other large language models, it still invents facts, makes reasoning errors, generates biased output, and couches incorrect statements in confident language. In addition, it lacks knowledge of events that transpired after September 2021, when its training corpus was finalized. OpenAI details the safety issues <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>. <br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> As language models become more capable, they become more useful. It’s notable that OpenAI believes this model is ready to commercialize from the get-go: This is the first time it has introduced a new model alongside product launches that take advantage of it.  <br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>Stable Diffusion, Phenaki, MusicLM, GPT-4: This is truly a golden time in AI!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/unnamed--47-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/unnamed--47-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"runaway-llama\">Runaway LLaMA</h1><p>Meta’s effort to make a large language model available to researchers ended with its escape into the wild.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Soon after Meta started accepting applications for developer access to LLaMA, a family of trained large language models, a user on the social network 4chan posted a downloadable BitTorrent link to the entire package, <em>The Verge</em> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23629362/meta-ai-language-model-llama-leak-online-misuse?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> LLaMA includes transformer-based models with 7 billion, 13 billion, 33 billion, and 65 billion parameters. The models were trained on Common Crawl, GitHub, Wikipedia, Project Gutenberg, ArXiv, and Stack Exchange. Tested on 20 zero- and few-shot tasks, LLaMA outperformed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">GPT-3</a> on all tasks, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Chinchilla</a> on all but one, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">PaLM</a> on all but two.</p><p><strong>Escape:</strong> On March 24, Meta had <a href=\"https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">offered</a> LLaMA to researchers at institutions, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations who requested access and agreed to a noncommercial license. A week later, 4chan leaked it.</p><ul><li>Users promptly hosted the model on sites including <a href=\"https://github.com/shawwn/llama-dl?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub</a> and Hugging Face. Meta filed takedown requests.</li><li>Users adapted it to widely available hardware. One <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35029766&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ran</a> the 65 billion-parameter model on a single Nvidia A100. Computer scientist Simon Willison <a href=\"https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/llama-7b-m2?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email\" rel=\"noopener\">implemented</a> the 13 billion-parameter version on a MacBook Pro M2 with 64 gigabytes of RAM.</li><li>Alfredo Ortega, a software engineer and user of 4chan, which is infamous for hosting objectionable content, implemented the 13 billion-parameter LLaMA as a Discord chatbot. Users have prompted the program (nicknamed BasedGPT) to output hate speech. Ortega <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11kr20f/r_created_a_discord_server_with_llama_13b/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">noted</a> that his implementation was a legitimate download.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Efforts to release <a href=\"https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/bloom?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">similar</a> <a href=\"https://blog.eleuther.ai/announcing-20b/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">models</a> are ongoing even as the AI community continues to debate the potential risks and rewards. Those who favor limited access cite safety concerns believe that institutions are best positioned to study models and learn to control them. Proponents of open access argue that free enquiry offers the best route to innovation and social benefit.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>LLaMA gives experimenters, small developers, and members of the general public unprecedented access to cutting-edge AI. Such access likely will enable valuable scientific, practical, and commercial experimentation. While the risk of harm via automated generation of effective spam, scams, propaganda, disinformation, and other undesirable outputs is real, open source projects like BLOOM and GPT-NeoX-20B have led to significantly more benefit than harm — so far.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Making models like LLaMA widely available is important for further research. Ironically, bad actors will use the leaked LLaMA, while conscientious researchers will respect Meta’s copyright and abide by the rules. For instance, Stanford researchers announced <a href=\"https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Alpaca</a>, a LLaMA variant that’s fine-tuned to follow instructions. However, the Stanford team is holding back the trained weights while it discusses the matter with Meta. Considering the potential benefits and harms of restricted release versus openness, openness creates more benefits all around.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-fourthbrain\">A MESSAGE FROM <strong>FOURTHBRAIN</strong></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://fourthbrain.ai/building-generative-ai-apps/?utm_campaign=Building+Generati%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dsource%3Demail&utm_term=batch-ad-3-15&utm_content=batch-ad-3-15&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/Building-Generative-AI-Applications--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1728\" height=\"972\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/Building-Generative-AI-Applications--1-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/Building-Generative-AI-Applications--1-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/03/Building-Generative-AI-Applications--1-.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/Building-Generative-AI-Applications--1-.png 1728w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Learn how to build and deploy an end-to-end application using open source generative AI tools at a one-day workshop with FourthBrain.
