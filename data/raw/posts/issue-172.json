Two days later, amid controversy regarding the model’s potential to generate false or misleading articles, the company withdrew it. </em></p><p><em>Is Galactica dangerous? How should researchers, as well as the broader AI community, approach such developments?</em></p><p><em>Michael Black, director of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michael_j_black/status/1593133722316189696?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_X9dgflKKIB9X0cYyeTNFmsYGmyDE0Mj7YKcqUcOU2cPXmq4GSYmYQ2e3JhdecNio8aApx\" rel=\"noopener\">raised concern</a> about Galactica’s potential for harm by generating seemingly authoritative scientific papers that are factually bonkers.

He pointed out that, despite worries that people might misuse large language models (LLMs), it largely hasn’t happened.</em></p><p><em>At the risk of offending both sides, let me share my take.</em></p><ul><li><em>I support the Galactica researchers. Their scientific work on large language models is technically interesting and impressive. Their model does well on tasks such as mathematical reasoning and answering multiple-choice questions.</em></li><li><em>When a technology shows potential to cause significant harm, it’s important to carefully assess the likely benefits against the likely harm. One problem with the way Galactica was released is that we don’t yet have a robust framework for understanding of the balance of benefit versus harm for this model, and different people have very different opinions. Reading through the paper, I see potential for exciting use cases. I also see risk of large-scale fakery that could cause harm. While I support the technical work, I would prefer that the demo had been released only after a more thorough assessment.</em></li><li><em>Prior to a careful analysis of benefit versus harm, I would not recommend “move fast and break things” as a recipe for releasing any product with potential for significant harm. I would love to see more extensive work — perhaps through limited-access trials — that validates the product’s utility to third parties, explores and develops ways to ameliorate harm, and documents this thinking clearly.</em></li><li><em>That said, I would also love to see less vitriol toward researchers who are trying to do their best. People will differ on the best path forward, and all of us sometimes will be right and sometimes will be wrong. I believe the Meta researchers are trying to do their best. Whether we agree or disagree with their approach, I hope we’ll treat them with respect.</em></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/unnamed--15--1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screen capture of Galactica demo\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"336\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/unnamed--15--1.gif 600w\"></figure><ul><li><em>Part of the disagreement likely stemmed from widespread distrust of Meta, where a focus on maximizing user engagement has contributed to social polarization and spread of disinformation. If a lesser-known or more-trusted company had released Galactica, I imagine that it would have had more leeway. For instance, Stability AI released its Stable Diffusion text-to-image model with few safeguards. The company faced little criticism, and so far the model has spurred great <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/text-to-image-generation-and-the-path-to-truly-open-ai?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">creativity</a> and little <a href=\"https://techpolicy.press/researchers-find-stable-diffusion-amplifies-stereotypes/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_X9dgflKKIB9X0cYyeTNFmsYGmyDE0Mj7YKcqUcOU2cPXmq4GSYmYQ2e3JhdecNio8aApx\" rel=\"noopener\">harm</a>. I don’t think this is necessarily an unfair way to approach companies. A company’s track record does matter. Considering the comparatively large resources big companies can use to drive widespread awareness and adoption of new products, it’s reasonable to hold them to a higher standard.</em></li><li><em>The authors withdrew the model shortly after the controversy arose. Kudos to them for acting in good faith and responding quickly to the community’s concerns.</em></li></ul><p><em>When it comes to building language models that generate more factually accurate output, the technical path forward is not yet clear. LLMs are trained to maximize the likelihood of text in their training set. This leads them to generate text that sounds plausible — but a LLM that makes up facts can also perform well on this training objective.</em></p><p><em>Some engineers (including the Galactica’s team) have proposed that LLMs could be an alternative to search engines. For example, instead of using search to find out the distance to the Moon, why not pose the question as a prompt to a language model and let it answer? Unfortunately, the maximum-likelihood objective is not well aligned with the goal of providing factually accurate information. To make LLMs better at conveying facts, research remains to be done on alternative training objectives or, more likely, model architectures that optimize for factual accuracy rather than likelihood.</em></p><p><em>Whether a tool like Galactica will be more helpful or harmful to society is not yet clear to me. There will be bumps in the rollout of any powerful technology.

When acclaimed artist Kim Jung Gi <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-10-05/kim-jung-gi-death-heart-attack?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_X9dgflKKIB9X0cYyeTNFmsYGmyDE0Mj7YKcqUcOU2cPXmq4GSYmYQ2e3JhdecNio8aApx\" rel=\"noopener\">died</a> in early October, within one day a former game developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BG_5you/status/1578146498768175105?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_X9dgflKKIB9X0cYyeTNFmsYGmyDE0Mj7YKcqUcOU2cPXmq4GSYmYQ2e3JhdecNio8aApx\" rel=\"noopener\">released</a> a model trained to produce works in his style. While the developer justified the work “as an homage,” responses included not only criticism and insults but also threats of violence. Such comments, one commenter noted, were part of a recent rise in “extremely violent rhetoric directed at the AI art community.”</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Generative AI is attracting attention and <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/generative-ai-startups-raise-hundreds-of-millions-in-funding/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">funding</a>, but the ethics of training and using such systems are still coming into focus. For instance, lawyers are <a href=\"https://githubcopilotinvestigation.com/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_X9dgflKKIB9X0cYyeTNFmsYGmyDE0Mj7YKcqUcOU2cPXmq4GSYmYQ2e3JhdecNio8aApx\" rel=\"noopener\">preparing</a> to argue that GitHub’s CoPilot code-generation system, which was trained on open-source code, violates open-source licenses by improperly crediting coders for their work. The outcome may resolve some uncertainty about how to credit a generative model’s output — but it seems unlikely to address issues of permission and compensation.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Artists who have devoted years to developing a distinctive style are justifiably alarmed to see machines crank out imitations of their work. Some kind of protection against copycats is only fair. For the time being, though, the limit of fair use in training and using AI models remains an open question.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/unnamed--17-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Charts showing performance scaling of TPU vs GPU on MLPerf-Transformer and Cerebras GPT-3 XL Performance\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/unnamed--17-.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/unnamed--17-.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/unnamed--17-.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"built-to-scale\">Built to Scale</h1><p>A new computing cluster delivers more bang per chip.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Cerebras, one of several startups vying to supply the market for specialized AI chips, <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.net/andromeda/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_X9dgflKKIB9X0cYyeTNFmsYGmyDE0Mj7YKcqUcOU2cPXmq4GSYmYQ2e3JhdecNio8aApx\" rel=\"noopener\">unveiled</a> Andromeda, a supercomputer based on its processors.

In the usual approach, the model plays itself and learns from all moves. In the authors’ version, the model played against a fixed KataGo model and learned only from its own moves, learning to exploit holes in KataGo’s strategy rather than becoming a conventionally savvy player.</li><li>The authors’ model forecasted its next moves using its own model, and it forecasted KataGo’s likely responses to those moves using KataGo’s model. It combined the forecasts to determine its next action. (KataGo can be configured to perform similar forecasting, but the authors didn’t use this capability while training their model.)</li><li>During training, once the model had won 50 percent of games, the authors increased the difficulty by pitting it against a version of KataGo that had been trained longer.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The model’s winning strategy involved taking control of a corner of the board and adding a few easy-to-capture pieces outside that area.</p><ul><li>This strategy enabled a version that predicted 600 moves ahead to win more than 99 percent of games against a KataGo that didn’t look ahead (which ranks among the top 100 European players).</li><li>A version that predicted the next 4,096 moves won 54 percent of games against a KataGo that looked 64 moves ahead (which ranks among the top 20 players worldwide).</li><li>The model lost to a naive human player who hadn’t played Go prior to undertaking the research project.</li><li>However, the naive player wasn’t able to defeat KataGo using the model’s strategy. This suggests that the strategy was less critical to the model’s victory than exploiting specific flaws in KataGo.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This work is a helpful reminder that neural networks are brittle, particularly to adversarial attacks that take advantage of a specific system’s idiosyncrasies. Even in the limited context of a game board, a model that achieves superhuman performance can be defeated by a simple — but unusual — strategy.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> AI practitioners perform exploratory data analysis and address potential attacks, but vulnerabilities always remain.

Training and testing different models on many permutations of the data can reveal principles to guide the choice of architecture for any given dataset.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors compiled datasets, trained a variety of models (using a variety of hyperparameters), and evaluated their performance. Then they applied transformations to the data, retrained the models, and tested them again to see how the transformations affected model performance.</p><ul><li>The authors collected 45 tabular datasets useful for both classification problems like predicting increase/decrease in electricity prices and regression problems such as estimating housing prices.

They trained each model 400 times, searching randomly through a predefined hyperparameter space. They evaluated classification performance according to test-set accuracy and regression models according to R2, which measures how well a model estimates the ground-truth data.</li><li>In one transformation of the data, they used a random forest model to rank the importance of a dataset’s features and trained models on various proportions of informative versus uninformative features. In another, they smoothed labels like 0 or 1 into labels like .2 or .8.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Averaged across all tasks, the best tree models performed 20 percent to 30 percent better than the best deep learning models. ResNets fell even farther behind trees and transformers as the number of uninformative features rose. In another experiment, training on smoothed labels degraded the performance of trees more than that of neural networks, which suggests that tree-based methods are better at learning irregular mapping of training data to labels.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Deep learning isn’t the best approach to all datasets and problems.
