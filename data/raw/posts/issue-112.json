From the point of view of a computer-vision algorithm — as well as the human eye — the imaging setup that produced the picture on the right makes a defect in the gear much easier to spot.</em><br><br><em>This example illustrates the power of data-centric AI development. If you want to improve a neural network’s performance, often improving the data it analyzes is far quicker and easier than tinkering with its architecture. In this case, adjusting the imaging setup made the difference.</em><br><br><em>How can you tell that your imaging setup has room for improvement? If you can look at a physical object from a given angle and spot a defect, but you don’t see it clearly in a photo taken from the same angle, then your imaging setup likely could be improved. Parameters that you can control include</em></p><ul><li><em><strong>Illumination:</strong> Is the scene well lit (with diffuse and/or spot lighting), at angles that make clearly visible the features you want your model to recognize? Have you controlled ambient sources such as windows and reflections that may make images less consistent? Are the resulting images consistent and free of glare?</em></li><li><em><strong>Camera position:</strong> Make sure the camera is well positioned to capture the relevant features. A defect in, say, a drinking glass or touch screen may be visible from one angle but not from another. And a camera that shakes or moves in response to surrounding vibrations can’t produce consistent images.</em></li><li><em><strong>Image resolution:</strong> The density of pixels that cover a given area should be high enough to capture the features you need to see.</em></li><li><em><strong>Camera parameters:</strong> Factors such as focus, contrast, and exposure time can reveal or hide important details. Are the features you aim to detect clearly in focus? Are the contrast and exposure chosen to make them easy to see?</em></li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table class=\"hse-image-wrapper\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px !important;\"><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(59, 59, 59); word-break: break-word; text-align: center; padding: 10px 0px; font-size: 0px;\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-10-06 at 11.17.27 AM copy\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/5871640/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-06%20at%2011.17.27%20AM%20copy.png?upscale=true&amp;width=1200&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-10-06%20at%2011.17.27%20AM%20copy.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"middle\" class=\"stretch-on-mobile\" style=\"outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width: 100%; font-size: 16px;\"></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><em>While deep learning has been used successfully with datasets in which the examples vary widely — say, recognizing faces against backgrounds that range from a crowded concert hall to an outdoor campsite — narrowing the data distribution simplifies computer vision problems. For example, if you want to detect diseased plants, deep learning may be your best bet if you have pictures of plants taken at various distances and under various lighting conditions. But if all the pictures are taken at a fixed distance under uniform lighting, the problem becomes much easier. In practical terms, that means the model will be more accurate and/or need a lot fewer examples. With a consistent dataset, I’ve seen neural networks learn to perform valuable tasks with just 50 images per class (even though I would love to have had 5,000!).</em><br><br><em>Robotics engineers are accustomed to paying attention to the design of imaging systems (as well as audio and other sensor systems).

National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chair Jennifer Homendy recently <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682272/ntsb-official-tesla-safety-elon-musk-full-self-driving?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WW4Woe1bkMvRM_F_OEmOjFOvxcpKFzO2MXwTE6b_2hSSnVuN42JtfNI3FyDSuSIkTUrRu\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> that Tesla’s use of the term “full self-driving” is irresponsible and called on the company to address basic safety issues before expanding the test program. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has the authority to demand recalls, is <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a37465030/tesla-autopilot-data-nhtsa-october-22-investigation/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WW4Woe1bkMvRM_F_OEmOjFOvxcpKFzO2MXwTE6b_2hSSnVuN42JtfNI3FyDSuSIkTUrRu\" rel=\"noopener\">investigating</a> the culpability of Tesla’s software in 11 accidents.<br><br><strong>Why it matters</strong>: Self-driving technology is still developing and has not yet been proven safe under the vast variety of circumstances that arise in real-world driving. Most companies that are developing such technology hire safety drivers to test their systems within tightly constrained boundaries. In contrast, Tesla is enrolling the best drivers of Tesla vehicles to test its system on the open road.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Scoring driver behavior and limiting the distribution of special features only to the safest drivers is a good idea, assuming the score is well designed and implemented. It both ensures that only excellent drivers can use the riskiest features and incentivizes all drivers to do their best. But recruiting customers to test unproven technology is reckless. We urge Tesla, and any company that would consider following its lead, to prove its technology’s safety under controlled conditions before putting the general public at risk. And can we stop calling a great driver assistance system “full self-driving”?</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table class=\"hse-image-wrapper\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px !important;\"><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(59, 59, 59); word-break: break-word; text-align: center; padding: 5px 0px 10px; font-size: 0px;\"><img alt=\"LONGTAIL-1\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/5871640/hubfs/LONGTAIL-1.gif?upscale=true&amp;width=1200&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=LONGTAIL-1.gif\" width=\"600\" align=\"middle\" class=\"stretch-on-mobile\" style=\"outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width: 100%; font-size: 16px;\"></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"oddball-recognition\">Oddball Recognition</h1><p>Models trained using supervised learning struggle to classify inputs that differ substantially from most of their training data. A new method helps them recognize such outliers.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Abhijit Guha Roy, Jie Ren, and colleagues at Google developed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03829v1?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WW4Woe1bkMvRM_F_OEmOjFOvxcpKFzO2MXwTE6b_2hSSnVuN42JtfNI3FyDSuSIkTUrRu\">Hierarchical Outlier Detection</a> (HOD), a loss function that helps models learn to classify out-of-distribution inputs — even if they don’t conform to a class label in the training set.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Previous work has proposed two general approaches to handling out-of-distribution inputs. One is to include a catch-all outlier class in the training set. Given the diversity of examples in this class, however, it’s difficult to learn to recognize outliers consistently. The other is to label separate outlier classes in the training set. This enables a trained model to recognize certain kinds of outliers but leaves it unable to identify outlier classes that aren't represented in the training set. HOD attempts to cover the gamut by encouraging a model to classify images both as outliers in general and as specific classes of outlier.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors started with a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WW4Woe1bkMvRM_F_OEmOjFOvxcpKFzO2MXwTE6b_2hSSnVuN42JtfNI3FyDSuSIkTUrRu\">ResNet</a> pretrained on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WW4Woe1bkMvRM_F_OEmOjFOvxcpKFzO2MXwTE6b_2hSSnVuN42JtfNI3FyDSuSIkTUrRu\">JFT</a> (Google's proprietary collection of 300 million images). They fine-tuned it on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05382?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WW4Woe1bkMvRM_F_OEmOjFOvxcpKFzO2MXwTE6b_2hSSnVuN42JtfNI3FyDSuSIkTUrRu\">images</a> of roughly 10,000 cases of skin disease, each labeled according to 225 different conditions. Of these, 26 conditions were represented by at least 100 cases; these were assigned an additional “inlier” label. The remaining 199 were assigned an additional “outlier” label. The training, validation, and test sets included a a variety of inlier classes, but the outlier classes were divided among them; that is, the datasets had no outlier classes in common.</p><ul><li>The ResNet generated a representation of each image in a case. It averaged the representations and passed them through a fully connected layer, forming a single representation of the case.</li><li>A softmax layer used this representation to identify the condition. Then the model assigned an inlier or outlier label depending on whether the sum of the probabilities of predicting an outlier class exceeded a threshold set by the user.</li><li>The HOD loss function contains two terms. One encourages the algorithm to identify the correct condition. The other encourages it to assign an accurate inlier or outlier label.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Training the model on both outlier status and specific outlier classes helped it learn to recognize outliers in general — although the task still proved difficult. The authors’ approach achieved .794 AUC, while the same architecture trained on only a general outlier label (plus labels for all inlier classes) achieved .756 AUC. When classifying inliers, the model trained on all labels achieved 74 percent accuracy, while the one given only a general outlier label achieved 72.8 percent accuracy.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Real-world applications can be rife with out-of-distribution data. This approach helps models detect both examples that are similar to those in the training dataset but not labeled (for example, new skin conditions) and examples that are substantially different (for example, pictures of iguanas).<br><strong>We're thinking:</strong> Giving models the ability to recognize edge cases could build greater trust in their output.</p>","comment_id":"615df9bcd989bf003b05e769","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/10/The-batch.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2021-10-06T12:32:12.000-07:00","updated_at":"2022-10-05T15:23:53.000-07:00","published_at":"2021-10-06T12:53:24.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"The image below shows two photos of the same gear taken under different conditions.
