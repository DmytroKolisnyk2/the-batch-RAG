Broad tariffs, implemented not just against adversaries but also steadfast allies, will damage the livelihoods of billions of people, create inflation, make the world more fragmented, and leave the U.S. and the world poorer. AI isn’t the solution to everything, but even amidst this challenging environment, I hope our community can hold together, keep building friendships across borders, keep sharing ideas, and keep supporting each other.</p><p>Much has been written about why high, widespread taxes on imports are harmful. In this letter, I’d like to focus on its possible effects on AI. One silver lining of the new tariffs is that they focus on physical imports, rather than digital goods and services, including intellectual property (IP) such as AI research inventions and software. IP is difficult to tax, because each piece of IP is unique and thus hard to value, and it moves across borders with little friction via the internet. Many international AI teams collaborate across borders and timezones, and software, including specifically open source software, is an important mechanism for sharing ideas. I hope that this free flow of ideas remains unhampered, even if the flow of physical goods is.</p><p>However, AI relies on hardware, and tariffs will slow down AI progress by restricting access to it. Even though a last-minute exception was made for semiconductors, taxing imports of solar panels, wind turbines, and other power-generation and -distribution equipment will diminish the ability to provide power to U.S. data centers. Taxing imports of servers, cooling hardware, networking hardware, and the like will also make it more expensive to build data centers. And taxing consumer electronics, like laptops and phones, will make it harder for citizens to learn and use AI.</p><p>With regard to data-center buildouts, another silver lining is that, with the rise of generative AI,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/life-in-low-data-gravity/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PuXQ5Baz0aC2e1QL8RZk9Jbl3_rLHfQxn3qAT0dDPQZxIVY2RKLQT8DFHN9eYTSFPCnVv\" rel=\"noopener\">data gravity has decreased</a>&nbsp;because compute processing costs are much greater than transmission costs, meaning it’s more feasible to place data centers anywhere in the world rather than only in close proximity to end-users. Even though many places do not have enough trained technicians to build and operate data centers, I expect tariffs will encourage data centers to be built around the world, creating more job opportunities globally.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/unnamed--73-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Black toddler sneakers with white soles on wooden floor, featuring Velcro strap and soft inner lining for comfort.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"677\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/unnamed--73-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/unnamed--73-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/unnamed--73-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Finally, tariffs will create increased pressure for domestic manufacturing, which might create very mild tailwinds for robotics and industrial automation. As U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/hubfs/Vance%20-%20automation.jpg?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pointed out</a>&nbsp;in 2017, the U.S. should focus on automation (and education) rather than on tariffs. But the U.S. does not have the personnel — or know-how, or supply chain — to manufacture many of the goods that it currently counts on allies to make. Robotics can be helpful for addressing a small part of this large set of challenges. Generative AI’s rate of progress in robotics is also significantly slower than in processing text, visual data, audio, and reasoning. So while the tariffs could create tailwinds for AI-enabled robotics, I expect this effect to be small.</p><p>My 4-year-old son had been complaining for a couple of weeks that his shoes were a tight fit — he was proud that he’s growing! So last Sunday, we went shoe shopping. His new shoes cost $25, and while checking out, I paused and reflected on how lucky I am to be able to afford them. But I also thought about the many families living paycheck-to-paycheck, and for whom tariffs leading to shoes at $40 a pair would mean they let their kids wear ill-fitting shoes longer. I also thought about people I’ve met in clothing manufacturing plants in Asia and Latin America, for whom reduced demand would mean less work and less money to take home to their own kids.</p><p>I don’t know what will happen next with the U.S. tariffs, and plenty of international trade will happen with or without U.S. involvement. I hope we can return to a world of vibrant global trade with strong, rules-based, U.S. participation. Until then, let’s all of us in AI keep nurturing our international friendships, keep up the digital flow of ideas — including specifically open source software — and keep supporting each other. Let’s all do what we can to keep the world as connected as we are able.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Andrew</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/data-analytics/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/V3_Sign_Up_Button_DeepLearning_Data_Analytics_Banner_2070x1080-01.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Promo banner for &quot;Python for Data Analytics&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1043\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/V3_Sign_Up_Button_DeepLearning_Data_Analytics_Banner_2070x1080-01.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/V3_Sign_Up_Button_DeepLearning_Data_Analytics_Banner_2070x1080-01.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/04/V3_Sign_Up_Button_DeepLearning_Data_Analytics_Banner_2070x1080-01.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2025/04/V3_Sign_Up_Button_DeepLearning_Data_Analytics_Banner_2070x1080-01.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Course 3 of the&nbsp;<em>Data Analytics Professional Certificate</em>&nbsp;is live!

The outputs of the larger first layer are sparse, which makes them interpretable “features,” or individual values that correspond to concepts. By mapping an input to highly activated features, we can identify the concepts that determine the model’s output.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The team replaced fully connected layers in Claude 3.5 Haiku with cross-layer transcoders and interpreted their features.</p><ul><li>The authors trained one cross-layer transcoder for each fully connected layer. Given the fully connected layer’s input, the cross-layer transcoder learned to minimize the difference between its output and the fully connected layer’s output. It also learned to minimize the number of non-zero weights.</li><li>To interpret a transcoder’s features, they substituted it for the corresponding fully connected layer and ran selected inputs through the model. They produced visualizations of inputs that caused a feature to have a high value and looked for commonalities among those inputs. In this way, they found that certain features were associated with specific words (like “rabbit”), concepts (like&nbsp;<em>large</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>capital city</em>), and next-word predictions (like “say D_”, indicating that the predicted token should start with the letter D), or “say capital,” (indicating that the predicted token should be a capital city).</li><li>For each of several prompts, such as, “The opposite of small is,” they simplified a Claude 3.5 Haiku model to examine its response. They replaced the fully connected layers with cross-layer transcoders and reduced the attention computation (based on how it activated for the prompt). The simplified model was essentially a fully connected neural network.</li><li>They built a graph that interpreted how the replacement model produced outputs. The nodes were features, and the edges represented a high contribution of one feature to another feature in a later intermediate layer. Then they replaced the features with their corresponding interpretations. For instance, if the input prompt was, “The opposite of small is,” the graph connected the feature&nbsp;<em>opposite</em>&nbsp;to the feature&nbsp;<em>antonym</em>, and it connected the features&nbsp;<em>antonym</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>small</em>&nbsp;to the output feature “say large.”</li><li>They verified causal relationships between inputs, interpretations, and outputs by replacing specific layer outputs with outputs corresponding to a different interpretation. For instance, they replaced the values that represented&nbsp;<em>antonym</em>&nbsp;with values that represented&nbsp;<em>synonym</em>. After this intervention, prompted with “the opposite of small is,” the model generated the synonym “little” (instead of the antonym “large”).</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors built graphs that show how Claude 3.5 Haiku computes its output over a number of selected prompts.</p><ul><li>A graph for the prompt, “Fact: the capital of the state containing Dallas is” showed that the model determined internally that Dallas is in Texas, and then predicted Austin from the ideas “say a capital” and “Texas.” In other words, the model took steps rather than predicting “Austin” directly. To verify this conclusion, the authors replaced the features for “Texas” with the features for “California.” The model generated “Sacramento.”</li><li>Given a prompt that mentioned several symptoms of an illness and asked which one best clarified a potential diagnosis, the model took into account the various symptoms, produced potential diagnosis internally, considered various diagnostic criteria, and decided which one to output.</li><li>The authors’ graphs revealed how the model, prompted to describe its chain of thought, sometimes produced misleading output. Given a simple math problem and asked for the solution and the steps taken to find it, the model computed the answer correctly, and the graph and chain of thought matched. But given a more complex problem along with the expected solution and a request to double check it, the model’s chain of thought rationalized an incorrect solution, while the graph showed that the model had backtracked from the solution rather than trying to solve the problem. Given the same problem without the expected solution, the chain of thought described using a calculator, while the graph showed that the model had simply guessed an incorrect solution.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong>&nbsp;Last year, Google trained models to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/googles-gemma-scope-probes-how-large-language-models-think/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PuXQ5Baz0aC2e1QL8RZk9Jbl3_rLHfQxn3qAT0dDPQZxIVY2RKLQT8DFHN9eYTSFPCnVv\" rel=\"noopener\">examine individual features</a>&nbsp;in Gemma 2.

Anthropic’s method reveals not only whether a model reasons or takes a shortcut, but also what it truly does well and what it only professes to do well.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;The authors’ approach to examining how large language models generate output is interesting. We wonder whether even pre-transformer vanilla neural networks would appear to perform some sort of “reasoning” if we were to interpret them in a similar way.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/unnamed--57-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Llama 4 Behemoth benchmark chart comparing coding, reasoning, and multilingual scores with Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4.5.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/unnamed--57-.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/unnamed--57-.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/unnamed--57-.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"llama%E2%80%99s-mixture-of-vision-language-experts\">Llama’s Mixture of Vision-Language Experts</h1><p>Meta updated its popular open-weights models, claiming performance superior to closed competitors in three size classes.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;Meta released two vision-language models in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PuXQ5Baz0aC2e1QL8RZk9Jbl3_rLHfQxn3qAT0dDPQZxIVY2RKLQT8DFHN9eYTSFPCnVv\" rel=\"noopener\">Llama 4</a>&nbsp;family (Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick) and teased a third (Llama 4 Behemoth).

If each example is an entire dataset, it learns to recognize patterns across all those datasets. Trained in this way on enough datasets, it can generalize to new ones. Applying this idea to tabular data, a transformer — unlike a decision tree — can learn to perform classification and regression on any dataset without further training; that is, without further updating the model weights.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors generated 100 million datasets and used them to pretrain two small transformers (around 7 million and 11 million parameters respectively) to perform classification or regression. Given a dataset of rows (say, patient data labeled diagnoses or real-estate data labeled with prices) and one final row that’s unlabeled, the models learned to generate the missing label or value. Each dataset consisted of up to 2,048 rows (examples) and up to 160 columns (features).</p><ul><li>To generate a dataset, the authors sampled hyperparameters, such as the number of rows and columns, and produced a graph in which each node is a potential column, and each edge describes how one column is related to another mathematically. They sampled the mathematical relationships randomly; for example, one column might be the sum of a second column with the sine of a third. They selected a subset of nodes at random, creating columns, and propagated random noise through them to fill the columns with values. To simulate real-world imperfections, they removed some values and added noise at random.</li><li>The authors modified the transformer’s attention mechanism. Where a typical transformer block contains an attention layer and a fully connected layer, the authors included a feature attention layer (in which each cell attended to other cells in its column), an example attention layer (in which each cell attended to other cells in its row), and a fully connected layer.</li><li>The authors trained the model to estimate the missing label in each synthetic dataset. At inference, given a dataset (with labels) and an unlabeled example, the model predicted the label.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors tested the system on 29 classification datasets and 28 regression datasets from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openml.github.io/automlbenchmark/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PuXQ5Baz0aC2e1QL8RZk9Jbl3_rLHfQxn3qAT0dDPQZxIVY2RKLQT8DFHN9eYTSFPCnVv\" rel=\"noopener\">AutoML</a>&nbsp;benchmark and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=HebAOoMm94&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PuXQ5Baz0aC2e1QL8RZk9Jbl3_rLHfQxn3qAT0dDPQZxIVY2RKLQT8DFHN9eYTSFPCnVv\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenML-CTR23</a>. Each dataset contained up to 10,000 rows, 500 columns, and 10 classes. They compared TabPFN to the popular gradient-boosted tree approaches CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost.</p><ul><li>To evaluate classification, the authors measured area under the curve (AUC, higher is better) and normalized the resulting scores across the datasets to range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best). TabPFN performed best across the datasets tested, achieving an average 0.939 normalized AUC, while the best contender, CatBoost, achieved an average 0.752 normalized AUC.</li><li>To evaluate regression, the authors measured root mean squared error (RMSE). They normalized the resulting scores to range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best). TabPFN achieved 0.923 normalized RMSE, while the next-best method, Catboost, achieved 0.872 normalized RMSE.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:&nbsp;</strong>The authors’ method is slower than decision tree methods with respect to inference. To process a 10,000-row dataset, TabPFN required 0.2 seconds while CatBoost took 0.0002 seconds.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Transformers trained on large datasets of text or images can perform tasks they weren’t specifically trained for and generalize to novel datasets when performing tasks they were trained for. But when it comes to tabular data, they haven’t been competitive with decision trees. This work bridges the gap, unlocking a wide variety of new use cases for transformers.
