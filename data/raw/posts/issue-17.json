Now the company is drawing fire for using private data without informing customers and sharing data with police.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> A three-part exposé in <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmjp53/how-ring-went-from-shark-tank-reject-to-americas-scariest-surveillance-company?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\"><em>Vice</em></a> is the latest in a series of media reports charging that Ring, an Amazon subsidiary, mishandles private data in its efforts to promote AI-powered “smart policing.” <br><strong><br>How it works:</strong> Ring’s flagship products are doorbells with integrated camera, microphone, and speaker. The camera’s face and object recognition software alerts users, via a smartphone or connected-home device, whenever someone or something enters its field of view. Users can talk with people at the door remotely through the microphone and speaker.</p><ul><li>Ring has found success promoting its devices as crime-prevention tools. It bolsters this reputation by advertising its partnerships with more than 600 U.S. police departments and 90 city governments. In return for the implicit endorsement, Ring provides police departments with free devices and access to user data.</li><li>The company exports user data to its R&amp;D office in Kiev, Ukraine, to train its models. A December 2018 report by <em>The Information </em><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/at-rings-r-d-team-security-gaps-and-rookie-engineers?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">documented</a> a lax security culture in Kiev, where employees routinely shared customer video, audio, and personal data. Ring says it uses only videos that users have shared publicly (generally with neighbors and/or police) through an app, and that it has a zero-tolerance policy for privacy violations.</li><li>Google Nest, Arlo, Wyze, and ADP also offer smart doorbells. Ring, however, is the only one sharing data with police departments.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> When it was founded in 2012, Ring was called DoorBot and marketed its system as a hassle-free way to see who’s at the door. The following year, founder Jamie Siminoff appeared on the TV game show Shark Tank. While he didn’t sway the show’s celebrity investors, he raised several million dollars soon after, and changed the name to Ring. In recent years, he has pivoted from promoting the doorbell as a way to enhance social life to <a href=\"https://www.ispot.tv/ad/d4Ci/ring-video-doorbell-pro-tough-on-crime-black-friday-deals?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">positioning</a> it as a crime-prevention tool. In 2018, Amazon purchased Ring for $839 million and now markets the product as part of its Alexa smart-home services. <br><br><strong>Pushback:</strong> Troubled by the privacy implications of sharing customer data with police, 36 civil rights groups published an <a href=\"https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2019-10-07-open-letter-calling-on-elected-officials-to-stop/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">open letter </a>calling for a moratorium on partnerships between Ring and public agencies. The letter also asked Congress to investigate the company.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong></p><p><em>Knock knock.</em></p><p><em>Who’s there?</em></p><p><em>Stopwatch.</em></p><p><em>Stopwatch who?</em></p><p><em>Stopwatching me and respect my privacy!</em></p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Factual20Consistency.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Automatically generated text summary\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"keeping-the-facts-straight\">Keeping the Facts Straight</h2><p>Automatically generated text summaries are becoming common in search engines and news websites. But existing summarizers often mix up facts. For instance, a victim’s name might get switched for the perpetrator’s. New research offers a way to evaluate factual consistency between source documents along with a measure to evaluate it.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Wojciech Kryściński and colleagues at Salesforce Research introduce <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12840?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">FactCC</a>, a network that classifies such inconsistencies. They also propose a variant called FactCCX that justifies the classifications by pointing out specific inconsistencies. <br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Earlier approaches to checking factual consistency determine whether a single source sentence implies a single generated sentence. But summaries typically draw information from many sentences. FactCC evaluates whether a source document as a whole implies a generated sentence.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors identified major causes of factual inconsistency in automated abstractive summaries (that is, summaries that don’t copy phrases directly from the source document). Then they developed programmatic methods to introduce such errors into existing summaries to generate a large training dataset. FactCC is based on a BERT language model fine-tuned on the custom dataset.</p><ul><li>The researchers created a training dataset by altering sentences from CNN news articles. Transformations included swapping entities, numbers, or pronouns; repeating or removing random words, and negating phrases (“snow is in the forecast” versus “snow is not in the forecast”).</li><li>Some transformations resulted in sentences whose meaning was consistent with the source, while others resulted in sentences with altered meaning. The authors labeled them accordingly.</li><li>The development and test sets consisted of sentences from abstractive summaries generated by existing models. Each sentence was labeled depending on whether it was factually consistent with the source.</li><li>BERT received the source document and a sentence from the generated summary. It predicted a binary classification of consistent or inconsistent.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> FactCC classified summary sentences with an F1 score of 0.51. By contrast, a BERT model trained on MNLI, a dataset of roughly 400,000 sentence pairs labeled as either concordant or contradictory, achieved an F1 score of 0.08. In a separate task, FactCC ranked pairs of new sentences (one consistent, one not) for consistency with a source. It awarded consistent sentences a higher rank 70 percent of the time, better by 2.2 percent than the best previous model ranking the same dataset.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> A tide of automatically generated text is surging into mainstream communications. Measuring factual consistency is a first step towards establishing further standards for generated text—indeed, an urgent step as worries intensify over online disinformation.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/volcano2.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Volcano erupting\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"predicting-the-next-eruption\">Predicting the Next Eruption</h2><p>AI is providing an early warning system for volcanoes on the verge of blowing their top.<br><br><strong>What happened:</strong> Researchers at the University of Leeds <a href=\"https://eos.org/research-spotlights/forecasting-volcanic-eruptions-with-artificial-intelligence?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">developed</a> a neural net that scans satellite data for indications that the ground near a volcano is swelling—a sign it may be close to erupting.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Satellites carrying certain sensors can track centimeter-scale deformations of Earth’s crust.

However, human eyeballs are neither numerous nor sharp enough to monitor data for all of Earth’s 1,400 active volcanoes.</p><ul><li>Matthew Gaddes, Andy Hooper, and Marco Bagnardi trained their model using a year’s worth of satellite imagery leading up to the 2018 eruption of a volcano in the Galapagos Islands.</li><li>Data came from a pair of European satellites that passed over the volcano every 12 days.</li><li>The model differentiates rapid ground-level changes associated with catastrophic eruptions from slower, more routine deformations.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Researchers at the University of Bristol <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00752-3?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">developed</a> a similar method to measure deformations in the Earth’s crust using satellite data. However, their model can be fooled by atmospheric distortion that produces similar signals in the data. The Leeds and Bristol groups plan to collaborate in side-by-side tests of their models on a global dataset in the near future. Another group based at Cornell University is attempting to make similar predictions through satellite data of surface temperature anomalies, ash, and gaseous emissions.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Approximately 800 million people live within the blast zones of active volcanoes, and millions of sightseers visit their slopes each year.

Deepfakes and other such tech, the administration warned, may “disrupt social order and violate people’s interests, creating political risks and bringing a negative impact to national security and social stability.”<br><br><strong>What could get you in trouble:</strong> The rules take effect January 1, 2020. They target both the creators of fake news and websites that host their content.</p><ul><li>The rules extend beyond explicitly malicious content.

New research shows that world models can emerge from standard training, rather than needing to be built separately.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Google Brain researchers C. Daniel Freeman, Luke Metz, and David Ha enabled an agent to build a world model by blindfolding it as it learned to accomplish tasks. They call their approach <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13038?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">observational dropout</a>.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Blocking an agent’s observations of the world at random moments forces it to generate its own internal representation to fill in the gaps. The agent learns this representation without being instructed to predict how the environment will change in response to its actions.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> At every timestep, the agent acts on either its observation (framed in red in the video above) or its prediction of what it wasn’t able to observe (imagery not framed in red). The agent contains a controller that decides on the most rewarding action. To compute the potential reward of a given action, the agent includes an additional deep net trained using the RL algorithm REINFORCE.</p><ul><li>Observational dropout blocks the agent from observing the environment according to a user-defined probability. When this happens, the agent predicts an observation.</li><li>If random blindfolding blocks several observations in a row, the agent uses its most recent prediction to generate the next one.</li><li>This procedure over many iterations produces a sequence of observations and predictions. The agent learns from this sequence, and its ability to predict blocked observations is tantamount to a world model.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Observational dropout solved the task known as <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/CartPole-v0?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Cartpole</a>, in which the model must balance a pole upright on a rolling cart, even when its view of the world was blocked 90 percent of the time. In a more complex <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01999?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Car Racing</a> task, in which a model must navigate a car around a track as fast as possible, the model performed almost equally well whether it was allowed to see its surroundings or blindfolded up to 60 percent of the time.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Modeling reality is often part art and part science. World models generated by observational dropout aren’t perfect representations, but they’re sufficient for some tasks. This work could lead to simple-but-effective world models of complex environments that are impractical to model completely.<br><strong><br>We’re thinking: </strong>Technology being imperfect, observational dropout is a fact of life, not just a research technique. A self-driving car or auto-piloted airplane reliant on sensors that drop data points could create a catastrophe. This technique could make high-stakes RL models more robust.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/foia.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Eric Schmidt on C-Span2\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"transparency-for-military-ai\">Transparency for Military AI</h2><p>A U.S. federal judge ruled that the public must be able to see records from a government-chartered AI advisory group.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> The <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/secret-artificial-intelligence-commission-subject-to-foia?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">court</a> <a href=\"https://www.law360.com/articles/1225030/privacy-group-gets-ok-to-seek-federal-ai-panel-s-records?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">decided</a> that the National Security Commission on AI, which guides defense research into AI-powered warfighting technology, must respond to freedom-of-information requests.<br><br><strong>What the suit says: </strong>The National Security Commission on AI was set up by Congress in late 2018, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center has been requesting its records under the Freedom of Information Act for almost as long.
