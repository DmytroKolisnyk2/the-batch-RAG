The most successful ones adjusted to corporate work by shifting their mindset in a few crucial ways.</em><br><br><em>The worlds of academia and industry are governed by different values. The former prizes scientific innovation and intellectual freedom, and the latter prizes building a successful business that delivers impact and profit. If you’re thinking of taking the leap, here are some tips that might ease the way.</em></p><ul><li><em><strong>Speed versus accuracy:</strong> In academia, publishing technically accurate work is paramount. For example, if you publish a paper saying algorithm A is superior to algorithm B, you’d better be right! In industry, often there’s no right answer. Should you build a system using algorithm A or B? Or should you tackle project X or Y? Rather than striving for the right answer, it’s frequently better to make a quick decision (especially if you have an opportunity to reverse it later).</em></li><li><em><strong>Return on investment (ROI) versus novelty:</strong> Academia places a high premium on fresh ideas. Many ideas are publishable at least partly because they’re different from their predecessors. (That said, smart researchers don’t just aim to publish, they aim to make a broader impact.) The corporate world evaluates innovations through the lens of ROI and their contribution to the business.</em></li><li><em><strong>Experienced versus junior teams:</strong> Universities are used to seeing individuals go from not knowing how to code to publishing groundbreaking research. As a result, corporate managers with an academic background often hire junior teams even when the task at hand calls for established expertise. As you know, I’m a strong believer in learning. While a degree program commonly takes years to complete, many business projects can’t wait for team members to grow into a role. By all means, invest heavily in educating your teams — and also consider when you need to hire experienced people to meet your deadlines.</em></li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table class=\"hse-image-wrapper\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px !important;\"><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(59, 59, 59); word-break: break-word; text-align: center; padding: 10px 0px; font-size: 0px;\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-10-13 at 11.14.15 AM copy\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/5871640/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-13%20at%2011.14.15%20AM%20copy.png?upscale=true&amp;width=1200&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-10-13%20at%2011.14.15%20AM%20copy.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"middle\" class=\"stretch-on-mobile\" style=\"outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width: 100%; font-size: 16px;\"></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><ul><li><em><strong>Interdisciplinary work versus disciplinary specialization:</strong> In academia, you can talk exclusively with other machine learning researchers all day long and, through the discussion, push forward the state of the art. In most companies, outside of research labs, a project may require input from teams focused on machine learning, software engineering, product development, sales/marketing, and other areas. To execute it, you need to understand areas outside your speciality and work productively with the teams responsible for them.</em></li><li><em><strong>Top-down versus bottom-up management:</strong> In an academic setting, decisions about where to devote attention frequently are made at the individual or research group level. In the corporate world, there’s a greater tendency toward top-down management to make sure that teams are aligned and execute successfully.</em></li></ul><p><em>The shift in mindset between academia and industry is significant, but knowing the key differences in advance can make it easier to shift appropriately.

A human composer in 1988 completed two movements, for which more source material was available, so the team set out to compose two more.</p><ul><li>Matthias Röder, director of the Karajan Institute, which promotes uses of technology in music, led musical experts in deciding how the sparse contents of the remaining sketches might fit into a symphonic format. Meanwhile, Rutgers University professor Ahmed Elgammal built an AI system to expand the sketches into a fully orchestrated score.</li><li>Elgammal adapted natural language models to music, he told <em>The Batch</em>. The system included components that generated variations on melodic themes, harmonized the results, created transitions, and assigned musical lines to instruments in the orchestra.</li><li>He trained the models first on annotated scores music that influenced Beethoven, later on the composer’s own body of work. To train the melodic model, for instance, he annotated passages of theme and development. Then he fed the model thematic material from the sketches to generate elaborations on it.</li><li>The system eventually generated over 40 minutes of music in two movements.</li></ul><p><strong>Everyone’s a critic: </strong>Composer Jan Swafford, who wrote a 2014 biography of Beethoven, <a href=\"https://van-magazine.com/mag/jan-swafford-beethoven-x/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--nlQXRW4-7X-ix91nIeK09eSC7HZEucHhs-tTrQrkj708vf7H2NG5TVZmAM8cfkhn20y50\" rel=\"noopener\">described</a> the finished work as uninspired and lacking Beethovenian traits such as rhythms that build to a sweeping climax.<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> In 2019, Huawei used AI powered by its smartphone processors to <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/huawei-ai-unfinished-symphony/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--nlQXRW4-7X-ix91nIeK09eSC7HZEucHhs-tTrQrkj708vf7H2NG5TVZmAM8cfkhn20y50\" rel=\"noopener\">realize</a> the final two movements of Franz Schubert’s unfinished Eighth Symphony. The engineers trained their model on roughly 90 pieces of Schubert’s work as well as pieces written by composers who influenced him. A human composer cleaned up the output, organized it into sections, and distributed the notes among various instruments.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> AI is finding its way into the arts in a variety of roles. As a composer, generally the technology generates short passages that humans can assemble and embellish. It’s not clear how much the team massaged the model’s output in this case, but the ambition clearly is to build an end-to-end symphonic composer.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Elgammal has published <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07068?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--nlQXRW4-7X-ix91nIeK09eSC7HZEucHhs-tTrQrkj708vf7H2NG5TVZmAM8cfkhn20y50\" rel=\"noopener\">work</a> on generative adversarial networks.
