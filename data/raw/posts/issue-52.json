That’s why community matters.</em></p><p><em>To my mind, the defining feature of a community is a shared set of values. The medical community prioritizes patients’ wellbeing. When one doctor meets another, their shared priorities immediately create trust and allow them to work together more effectively, say, consulting on complex cases or building initiatives to help underserved people. The academic community also has a history of collaboration stemming from its shared belief in the value of searching for and disseminating knowledge. So, too, in other fields.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1_Andrews20Letter202-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Andrew Ng's tweet\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><em>We in the AI community may share many aims, but the first step toward being more effective as a community is to converge on a set of values we can all stand behind.

It also touts AI features such as managing its devices’ energy consumption based on user habits and fusing successive photos into a single high-quality image.</li><li>Like Google, Huawei, Qualcomm, and Samsung, Apple designed specialized chips to run AI software on smartphones, tablets, and watches. Its laptops are expected to include the chip <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">later this year</a>.</li><li>Rather than executing tasks in the cloud, a chip subsystem called the <a href=\"https://www.idgconnect.com/news/1503078/inside-apples-a13-bionic-chip?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Neural Engine</a> processes most machine learning tasks on Apple devices.

Apple’s effort to avoid collecting and exposing user data is refreshing — and raises the stakes for small data techniques that enable systems to learn effectively with fewer examples.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/T-Shirt.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Images and data related to a t-shirt that tricks a variety of object detection models into failing to spot people\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"hidden-in-plain-sight\">Hidden in Plain Sight</h3><p>With the rise of AI-driven surveillance, anonymity is in fashion. Researchers are working on clothing that evades face recognition systems.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Kaidi Xu and colleagues at Northeastern, MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, and MIT designed a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11099?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">t-shirt</a> that tricks a variety of object detection models into failing to spot people.<br><br><strong>Key insight</strong>: Researchers have created <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1897?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">images</a> that, when held in front of a camera, can confuse an object detector. But surveillance cameras can view people from a range of distances and angles, and images on clothes warp as the wearer moves. To manage these limitations, the authors tracked a shirt’s deformations in motion. Then they mapped the same deformations onto candidate adversarial images until they found one that evaded the detector.<br><br><strong>How it works</strong>: Machine learning typically involves training a model to map an image to a label. Generating adversarial images involves choosing a label, holding model weights constant, and finding an input that causes the network to select that label. The researchers devised a design that, when projected onto a t-shirt, caused a variety of object detectors to classify “no label.”</p><ul><li>The researchers printed a checkerboard pattern onto a t-shirt and recorded videos of people wearing the shirt. The checkerboard pattern enabled them to measure the shirt’s deformation in each video frame as the pattern changed with wrinkles, lighting, or scale and angle.</li><li>Armed with these measurements, they used the interpolation technique known as thin plate spline (TPS) to replace the checkerboard in each frame with another image.</li><li>The TPS distortions are differentiable, so backprop can adjust the image to fool the object detector across all frames.</li><li>The adversarial image can be optimized to confuse any object detector or multiple detectors simultaneously. The researchers focused on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">YOLOv2</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Faster R-CNN</a>, which are commonly deployed in surveillance systems.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers printed an adversarial image onto a shirt and collected videos of it in action. It fooled YOLOv2 in 57 percent of frames, a big improvement over the previous <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08653?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">state of the art</a>’s 18 percent.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> A detector that classifies even a single frame correctly opens the door to defeating this technique. Practical adversarial wear may require a success rate nearer to 100 percent. If this technique takes off, face detection suppliers are bound to develop countermeasures.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Adversarial images have been added to training data to strengthen image classifiers against <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03034?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">attacks</a>. TPS could play a role in similar methods to prevent object detectors from being tricked.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Given that software to counter the authors’ technique can be updated faster than clothes manufacturing and distribution, we’re not convinced this approach can scale.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Birds203.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Data related to AI technology capable of spotting birds with sound and sight  \" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"birdwatching-with-ai\">Birdwatching With AI</h3><p>Neural networks learned to tell one bird from another, enabling scientists to study their behavior in greater detail.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers from universities in Europe and Africa trained neural networks to recognize individual birds with up to 90 percent accuracy, as detailed in <em><a href=\"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13436?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Methods in Ecology and Evolution</a></em>.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Researchers collected data by attaching radio-frequency identification tags to 35 of the African songbirds known as sociable weavers.

Rite-Aid terminated the program shortly before the report was published.<br><br><strong>Who’s minding the store:</strong> The company had installed the systems in 200 locations nationwide, according to internal documents.

A theoretical study shows that gradient descent itself may introduce such bias and render algorithms unable to fit data properly.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Suriya Gunasekar led colleagues at Toyota Technical Institute at Chicago, University of Southern California, and Technion-Israeli Institute of Technology to demonstrate that a model’s predictions can be <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08246?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">limited by its optimization method</a> regardless of the volume or distribution of training data. In some cases, gradient descent can’t find the optimal solution even with all the data in the world.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> The researchers considered a model’s ability to learn the optimal solution given a particular optimization method and loss function, as well as sufficient training data. They divided loss functions into two categories inspired by (A) linear regression with more parameters than data samples and (B) logistic regression when data classes are separable. Loss functions in category A have obtainable minima: The optimum sits at the bottom of a valley. Those in category B don’t: The optimum lies at the bottom of an infinitely long downward slope. Considering these categories separately enabled the authors to prove results for a variety of optimization methods.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers found that optimization hyperparameter values can limit the behavior of certain combinations of loss function and optimization method. A well known example: With enough momentum, gradient descent doesn’t get stuck in local minima, but with too little, it gets trapped.</p><ul><li>Linear regression with quadratic loss defines a convex optimization problem. On the other hand, in logistic regression, with some datasets, certain parameters must approach infinity to realize the optimum. The researchers measured bias in such scenarios by whether the optimizer could approach optimal performance given infinite time.</li><li>In linear models with gradient descent, optimizing losses in category A will always reach the optimal solution. When optimizing losses in category B, how close a model comes to finding an optimal solution depends on how long it trains.</li><li>A natural gradient descent optimizer updates weights by following the gradient and a defined flow (which encourages certain directions, similar to gravity). By extending their results from gradient descent, the researchers showed that natural gradient descent is also biased by the initialization.</li><li>For particular combinations of optimization method and loss function, the researchers were unable to quantify the gap between a solution and the optimum. But they did prove that the bias depends on a model’s learning rate and initialization. In such cases, gradient descent may get stuck in the local minima depending on the starting location.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> In theory, gradient descent with loss functions in category A depends on initialization but not hyperparameters. Moreover, momentum depends on both initialization and hyperparameters. For category B, gradient descent always converges on the correct solution given infinite time. <br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Theory and practice sometimes diverge, but theoretical analyses help simplify practical issues and provide clear guidance when questions arise.<br> <br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>How to select and tune optimization algorithms is often the realm of tribal knowledge.
