Vance&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/gregory_c_allen/status/1889300802956591187?s=61&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_MW3ZsUxv6LnR3aWKk39uK3CDNTbIgQI7K_wwBMtikGPI3agA7fgg5SSi5o1C5_C50Axhy\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a>, “I’m not here to talk about AI safety. ... I’m here to talk about AI opportunity.” I’m thrilled to see the U.S. government focus on opportunities in AI. Further, while it is important to use AI responsibly and try to stamp out harmful applications, I feel “AI safety” is not the right terminology for addressing this important problem. Language shapes thought, so using the right words is important. I’d rather talk about “responsible AI” than “AI safety.” Let me explain.</p><p>First, there are clearly harmful applications of AI, such as non-consensual deepfake porn (which creates sexually explicit images of real people without their consent), the use of AI in misinformation, potentially unsafe medical diagnoses, addictive applications, and so on. We definitely want to stamp these out! There are many ways to apply AI in harmful or irresponsible ways, and we should discourage and prevent such uses.</p><p>However, the concept of “AI safety” tries to make AI — as a technology — safe, rather than making safe applications of it. Consider the similar, obviously flawed notion of “laptop safety.” There are great ways to use a laptop and many irresponsible ways, but I don’t consider laptops to be intrinsically either safe or unsafe. It is the application, or usage, that determines if a laptop is safe. Similarly, AI, a general-purpose technology with numerous applications, is neither safe nor unsafe. How someone chooses to use it determines whether it is harmful or beneficial.</p><p>Now, safety isn’t always a function only of how something is used. An unsafe airplane is one that, even in the hands of an attentive and skilled pilot, has a large chance of mishap. So we definitely should strive to build safe airplanes (and make sure they are operated responsibly)! The risk factors are associated with the construction of the aircraft rather than merely its application. Similarly, we want safe automobiles, blenders, dialysis machines, food, buildings, power plants, and much more.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/RESPONSIBLE-AI_Blue-Or4_1200px--1--1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"“Responsible AI” written on a wall, with “Safety” crossed out in blue paint.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/RESPONSIBLE-AI_Blue-Or4_1200px--1--1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/RESPONSIBLE-AI_Blue-Or4_1200px--1--1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/RESPONSIBLE-AI_Blue-Or4_1200px--1--1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>“AI safety” presupposes that AI, the underlying technology, can be unsafe. I find it more useful to think about how applications of AI can be unsafe.</p><p>Further, the term “responsible AI” emphasizes that it is our responsibility to avoid building applications that are unsafe or harmful and to discourage people from using even beneficial products in harmful ways.</p><p>If we shift the terminology for AI risks from “AI safety” to “responsible AI,” we can have more thoughtful conversations about what to do and what not to do.</p><p>I believe the 2023 Bletchley AI Safety Summit slowed down European AI development — without making anyone safer — by wasting time considering science-fiction AI fears rather than focusing on opportunities. Last month, at Davos, business and policy leaders also had strong concerns about whether Europe can dig itself out of the current regulatory morass and focus on building with AI. I am hopeful that the Paris meeting, unlike the one at Bletchley, will result in acceleration rather than deceleration.</p><p>In a world where AI is becoming pervasive, if we can shift the conversation away from “AI safety” toward responsible [use of] AI, we will speed up AI’s benefits and do a better job of addressing actual problems. That will actually make people safer.</p><p>Keep building!</p><p>Andrew&nbsp;</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/attention-in-transformers-concepts-and-code-in-pytorch?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--11-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Promo banner for &quot;Attention in Transformers: Concepts and Code in PyTorch&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--11-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--11-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--11-.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--11-.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Understand and implement the attention mechanism, a key element in transformer-based LLMs, using PyTorch.

Alibaba has not released details about how it trained them.</p><ul><li>Qwen2.5-VL comprises a vision encoder and large language model. It can parse videos, images, text, and is capable of computer use (desktop and mobile).</li><li>The vision encoder accepts images of different sizes and represents them with different numbers of tokens depending on the size. For instance, one image might be 8 tokens and another 1125 tokens. This enabled the model to learn about the scale of images and to estimate the coordinates of objects in an image without rescaling.</li><li>To reduce computation incurred by the vision encoder, the team replaced attention (which considers the entire input context) with windowed attention (which limits the input context to a window around a given token) and used full attention only in four layers. The resulting efficiency improves training and inference speeds.</li></ul><p><strong>Results</strong>: Alibaba reports Qwen2.5-VL-72B’s performance on measures that span image and text problems, parsing documents, understanding videos, and interacting with computer programs.

While some approaches address this difficulty in training the underlying model, the agent architecture can also make a difference.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;Jing Yu Koh and colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University introduced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWFtn98tnvNfVxHryv6WJrNBVmLt1V5rZxh_MwF3S-3qgyTW6N1vHY6lZ3mGW33sV0K63TX_fW6qLlxx7YxG9GW2FB1bn5jDw4VW5Zntz52wD0_vW5ryxtN1-bDCHW3tdRFV4hh-5pW2JYklx2bCzyJVX-0JL1SK_jVW69ZyD56btDJNW6JG0lc1rWX30N2ncM2CN84C4W6jCTnC88-dhTW30LWj61pQ1ZsW71tJSy6wk-D-W9ffWpz60h4vvW8DDFKy2mkm-6W3HRsSD3dVXv7W6CrCXZ14bkgkW6D0nvF3q7FLsW2GhvKb6zdWk4W4knytQ3pNHWTW7KD0fl3LZCh3f5CRhb804?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">tree search for language model agents</a>, a method that allows agents to treat web interactions like tree searches. In this way, agents can explore possible chains of actions and avoid repeating mistakes.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;Some web tasks, for instance finding a price of a particular item, require a chain of intermediate actions: navigating to the right page, scrolling to find the item, matching an image of the item to the image on the page, and so on. If an agent clicks the wrong link during this process, it might lose its way. The ability to evaluate possible actions and remember previous states of web pages can help an agent correct its mistakes and choose a chain of actions that achieves its goal.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;An agent based on GPT-4o attempted 200&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VWFtn98tnvNfVxHryv6WJrNBVmLt1V5rZxh_MwF3SH3qgyTW69sMD-6lZ3mKW6RwhVb4vBRtSN8_2ZnjR6TmdW8qz456383tZ5V_RMkT5LPlY0W4JBgyz2HRjtbW7Pt5wG4MP4K5W1lrtC72FdT3ZW10FNBD14F6yjW6YRPry6PMW8LW7Gdm5v6d1NYlW1CHDvn1VrBMzW1psr2D4qCMMQW2tRBxS1Dsr99W920d1N40246wW2Xcjz95d2_pcW4VZSK14MRGK-N8DYPJVJqgkbW9hX2P36Gc1ZbW2mBV3f4qlw7sW33w3hs1mQcB6f2w-Ms004?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">tasks</a>&nbsp;using website mockups that mimicked an online retail store, Reddit-like forum, and directory of classified ads.

After each one, the LLM assessed the current state of the page using the previous states as context. The assessment assigned a value between 0 and 1 (meaning the task was complete). The agent kept a list of page states and their values.</li><li>The agent selected the web page state with the highest value after executing the five actions, and repeated the process, making a new set of five predictions based on the highest-value state.</li><li>This process is a search: The agent executed a chain of actions until the value of the new states dropped below the values of other states. If all new states had lower values, the agent backtracked to a previous state with a higher value and asked the LLM for five more actions. The search stopped when the agent had completed the task or explored 20 possible states.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors compared two agents, one that followed their search method and another that started at the same page and received the same instruction but took one action per state and never backtracked.
