I view these developments as the latest in an 18-month trend. Given the improvements we've seen, best practices for developers have changed as well.</p><p>Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, with key milestones that include the releases of GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3 Opus, and Llama 3-70B, many model providers have improved their capabilities in two important ways: (i) reasoning, which allows LLMs to think through complex concepts and and follow complex instructions; and (ii) longer input context windows.&nbsp;</p><p>The reasoning capability of GPT-4 and other advanced models makes them quite good at interpreting complex prompts with detailed instructions. Many people are used to dashing off a quick, 1- to 2-sentence query to an LLM. In contrast, when building applications, I see sophisticated teams frequently writing prompts that might be 1 to 2 pages long (my teams call them “mega-prompts”) that provide complex instructions to specify in detail how we’d like an LLM to perform a task. I still see teams not going far enough in terms of writing detailed instructions. For an example of a moderately lengthy prompt, check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmandaAskell/status/1765207842993434880?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PU4gmbfJN9_gBrzLMkZheDB1ROQnQWYv9cSxeMK53CO9ix0aYRLcabOd6v3xmmbHcM7HE\" rel=\"noopener\">Claude 3’s system prompt</a>. It’s detailed and gives clear guidance on how Claude should behave.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/05/unnamed--59--1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/unnamed--59--1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/unnamed--59--1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/05/unnamed--59--1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>This is a very different style of prompting than we typically use with LLMs’ web user interfaces, where we might dash off a quick query and, if the response is unsatisfactory, clarify what we want through repeated conversational turns with the chatbot.</p><p>Further, the increasing length of input context windows has added another technique to the developer’s toolkit. GPT-3 kicked off a lot of research on few-shot in-context learning. For example, if you’re using an LLM for text classification, you might give a handful — say 1 to 5 examples — of text snippets and their class labels, so that it can use those examples to generalize to additional texts. However, with longer input context windows — GPT-4o accepts 128,000 input tokens, Claude 3 Opus 200,000 tokens, and Gemini 1.5 Pro 1 million tokens (2 million just announced in a limited preview) — LLMs aren’t limited to a handful of examples.

The Model Spec outlines the principles — some new, some previously in use — that will drive those ratings. The principles are arranged hierarchically, and each category will override those below it.</p><ul><li>Three top-level objectives describe basic principles for model behavior: (i) “Assist the developer and end user” defines the relationship between humans and the model. (ii) “Benefit humanity” guides the model to consider both benefits and harms that may result from its behavior. (iii) “Reflect well on OpenAI” reinforces the company’s brand identity as well as social norms and laws.</li><li>Six rules govern behavior. In order, models are to prioritize platform rules above requests from developers, users, and tools; follow laws; withhold hazardous information; respect intellectual property; protect privacy; and keep their output “safe for work.” (These rules can lead to contradictions. For instance, the model will comply if a user asks ChatGPT to translate a request for drug-related information because the directive to follow requests from users precedes the one to withhold hazardous information.)</li><li>What OpenAI calls&nbsp;<em>defaults</em>&nbsp;govern the model’s interaction style. These include “ask clarifying questions when necessary,” “express uncertainty,” “assume an objective point of view,” and “don't try to change anyone's mind.” For example, if a user insists the Earth is flat, the model may respond, “Everyone's entitled to their own beliefs, and I'm not here to persuade you!”</li><li>The spec will evolve in response to the AI community’s needs. In the future, developers may be able to customize it. For instance, the company is considering allowing developers to lift prohibitions on “not safe for work” output such as erotica, gore, and some profanity.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:&nbsp;</strong>OpenAI’s use of the Model Spec and RLHF contrasts with<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Anthropic’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/toward-safer-more-helpful-models/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PU4gmbfJN9_gBrzLMkZheDB1ROQnQWYv9cSxeMK53CO9ix0aYRLcabOd6v3xmmbHcM7HE\" rel=\"noopener\">Constitutional AI</a>.

A second transformer refines the pairwise embeddings based on known molecules that share subsequences of amino acids or nucleotides with the input. A third transformer further refines the embeddings.</li><li>Given the features, embeddings, and a noisy point cloud of atoms, the diffusion model removes the noise. (That is, it learned to modify the atoms’ positions to match those in their dataset.)</li><li>AlphaFold 3 learned to optimize seven additional loss terms, including one that minimized the difference between the predicted and actual length of bonds between molecules and another that minimized the difference between predicted and actual distances between pairs of atoms.</li></ul><p><strong>Results</strong>: On&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/maabuu/posebusters?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PU4gmbfJN9_gBrzLMkZheDB1ROQnQWYv9cSxeMK53CO9ix0aYRLcabOd6v3xmmbHcM7HE\" rel=\"noopener\">PoseBusters</a>, a database of protein and protein-molecule shapes, AlphaFold 3 successfully found the shapes of about 77 percent of examples, while AutoDock Vina (a non-learning program that models molecular interactions) achieved about 53 percent.

Their method commands a robot to perform practical tasks, such as ironing a cloth or making a sandwich, via signals from an electroencephalogram (EEG), a non-invasive way to measure brain waves via electrodes attached to the scalp.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;Currently neuroscientists can derive from EEG signals only simple thoughts, such as the intention to move a limb. However, a sequence of simple thoughts can drive an arbitrarily complex action. Specifically, simple thoughts (such as the intention to move a hand) can drive a robot to perform complex actions by repeatedly (i) selecting an object, (ii) selecting an action to apply to the object, and (iii) selecting the part of the object to act upon. For instance, to iron a cloth, the initial sequence would be: (i) select the iron and (ii) grasp it (iii) by the handle. This sequence might be followed by (i) select the cloth and (ii) slide the iron across it (iii) starting at the nearest portion.

Given the EEG signal, one classifier selected the action.</li><li>To select a location on the object, the other classifier helped the user to point at it using a cursor. To move the cursor in one direction, the user imagined using one hand. To move it in the opposite direction, the user focused on a cross.
