Should It?</h2><p>The U.S. military is developing a new generation of automated weaponry. Some people are calling for automated generals as well.</p><p><strong>What happened:</strong> A pair of defense experts argue in <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2019/08/america-needs-a-dead-hand/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\"><em>War on the Rocks</em></a>, an online publication covering national security, that the Pentagon should replace the human chain of command over nuclear defense with machines. The time available to respond to incoming warheads has dwindled from hours during the Cold War to roughly 6 minutes today. The change makes automated command-and-control a necessity, they say. Their analysis added urgency to feature stories on military AI published last week in <em><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/09/killer-robots-and-new-era-machine-driven-warfare/597130/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">The Atlantic</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/09/07/artificial-intelligence-is-changing-every-aspect-of-war?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">The Economist</a></em>. <br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> The Department of Defense’s 2019 budget calls for nearly $1 billion in AI spending. Almost one-third of the money will fund the <a href=\"https://dodcio.defense.gov/About-DoD-CIO/Organization/JAIC/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Joint Artificial Intelligence Center</a> dedicated to establishing and scaling up AI throughout the military. The remainder of the department’s AI budget will support initiatives led by individual branches. Among those efforts:</p><ul><li>The Air Force is developing <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/a26871027/air-force-ai-fighter-plane-skyborg/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">SkyBorg</a>, an AI copilot for F-16s to help with navigation, radar awareness, and target recognition. The system will also pilot Valkyrie drones (pictured above) to serve as autonomous wingmen.</li><li>The Marine Corps is building <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/09/killer-robots-and-new-era-machine-driven-warfare/597130/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">self-driving assault boats</a> to deliver troops to a beach, then support the landing via autonomous .50 caliber machine guns.</li><li>The Navy is testing <a href=\"https://www.naval-technology.com/features/sea-hunter-inside-us-navys-autonomous-submarine-tracking-vessel/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Sea Hunter</a>, an autonomous ship intended eventually to destroy enemy submarines without human intervention.</li></ul><p><strong>The controversy:</strong> The debate over automated warfare follows trench lines similar to those of the earlier (and ongoing) argument over nuclear weapons.</p><ul><li>Pro-AI military experts fear that developments like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/magazine/hypersonic-missiles.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">hypersonic missiles</a> — capable of traveling up to 20 times the speed of sound — could decapitate the U.S. military before it has a chance to react. They argue that AI-driven warfare is imperative, if only for effective defenses.</li><li>But critics such as <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2019/08/strangelove-redux-us-experts-propose-having-ai-control-nuclear-weapons/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</a> warn that hackers, faulty code, or wayward machines could handicap AI-driven weapons. Moreover, non-nuclear autonomous weaponry could violate ethical and legal codes in the Geneva Conventions.</li></ul><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Autonomous weapons are terrifying enough. Autonomous nuclear weapons verge on the unthinkable. We strongly support the United Nations’ effort to establish a <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/03/1035381?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">ban on autonomous weapons</a> as a complement to <a href=\"https://www.nti.org/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">nuclear disarmament</a>. That said, AI has potential nonlethal uses like mine removal and search and rescue. It will take vigorous, well informed argument to arrive at military uses of AI that improve conditions for humanity as a whole. It’s critical that the AI community play an active role in the discussion.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/questionanswer.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Graph related to Language Model Analysis (LAMA)\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"what-language-models-know\">What Language Models Know</h2><p>Watson set a high bar for language understanding in 2011, when it famously whipped human competitors in the televised trivia game show <em>Jeopardy!</em> IBM’s special-purpose AI required around $1 billion and a squadron of engineers. New <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01066?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">research</a> suggests that today’s best language models can accomplish similar tasks right off the shelf.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers at Facebook AI Research and University College London pitted top-shelf language models against task-specific networks in a <em>Jeopardy!</em>-like challenge they call Language Model Analysis (LAMA). Their LAMA data set provides a large corpus of sentences, each missing a key fact.<br><br><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The latest language models are pretrained to address a variety of downstream tasks. In learning language representations, they retain knowledge that can be used to complete statements lacking key words.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> LAMA builds its incomplete sentences based on facts drawn from Google-RE (facts from Wikipedia), T-REx (facts aligned with Wikipedia text), ConceptNet (a semantic network), and SQuAD (questions and answers).</p><ul><li>LAMA requires models to fill in a missing subject or object. For example, “The theory of relativity was developed by ___.”</li><li>The researchers evaluated off-the-shelf versions of BERT, ELMo, and Transformer-XL without further training.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> BERT-Large filled in the blanks most accurately overall, and it was best at completing statements based on Google-RE and ConceptNet. It proved only half as accurate as task-specific models on LAMA’s SQuAD portion, which contains more complicated sentences. Similarly, BERT’s performance suffers when T-REx facts contain multiple subjects or blanks.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The Allen institute last week reported using BERT to score better than 90 percent on the multiple-choice questions in the New York Regents science test for the eighth grade. That system included additional task-specific models and retrieved external information to complete tasks. This research suggests that BERT as-is would score well on the Regents test.</p><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Large, pretrained language models can glean and recall nearly as much information — from some data sets, at least — as specially designed question answering models. This knowledge can allow them to accomplish various language tasks, including fill-in-the-blank, without special preparation.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chimpanzees20faces.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Face recognition app identifying individual chimpanzees in footage shot in the wilds of Guinea\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"chimp-recognition\">Chimp Recognition</h2><p>AI is capable of picking faces out of the crowd — even if that crowd is squabbling over bananas in a jungle.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers at the University of Oxford developed a <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/9/eaaw0736?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">face recognition app</a> that identifies individual chimpanzees in footage shot in the wilds of Guinea. The work could give wildlife conservation efforts a powerful new tool.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The group adapted the VGG-M convolutional neural network architecture. They trained the model on roughly 50 hours of footage representing 23 individuals over 14 years.</p><ul><li>The model identified apes as they aged.</li><li>It was able to recognize individuals regardless of low light, poor image quality, and facing away from the camera.</li><li>The researchers pitted their model against a human trained to recognize chimps.

The ability to track individuals enabled the researchers to map the tribe’s structure. The model generalized well to other primate species in preliminary tests. The researchers suggest that their approach could be used with other animals where a sufficient video record exists.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Applications like this could help cash-strapped conservation efforts to focus on translating data into action, and reduce the need for invasive, labor-intensive methods like tagging animals with RFID.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen20Shot202019-09-1120at2010.45.2720AM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>How can you tell when your neural network is overfitting?

Researchers aim to change that.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Most AI research demonstrating superhuman performance in Atari games applies widely varying limits on gameplay, such as how frequently buttons can be pressed. Researchers from MINES ParisTech and Valeo offer a standardized setup: Standardized Atari Benchmark for Reinforcement Learning (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04683.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Saber</a>). They use it to achieve a new state of the art in around 60 games from Pong to Montezuma’s Revenge.<br><br><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Marin Toromanoff, Emilie Wirbel, and Fabien Moutarde noticed that the reported human world-record scores average 1,000 times higher than the “expert human player” scores given in the first major deep reinforcement learning <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">paper</a> published in late 2013. Analyzing the settings used in deep learning publications since, the team pinpointed seven potential causes for reported variations in performance.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors propose a set of guidelines designed to match human capabilities. Their benchmark includes a new metric for evaluating models, since the previous human benchmark misrepresents human capabilities.</p><ul><li>Saber removes limitations on gaming time — it takes time for human players to rack up a world record! — rather than the few minutes many researchers allow.</li><li>The benchmark specifies that models can receive only the game screen as input, no further information allowed. For example, they must be able to use all buttons even if some don’t function.</li><li>The benchmark ranks models on a normalized scale in which 0 represents a score obtained by pressing buttons randomly and 1 is the human world record.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers tested a state-of-the-art model, Rainbow-IQN, and achieved an average of only 31% of the best human scores. The model achieved superhuman scores in four of 58 games.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Training reinforcement learning models is so laborious that researchers often don’t bother to reproduce previous results to see how their own stack up. Saber finally provides a consistent basis for comparison.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Deep reinforcement learning research is exciting, but a lack of standardized benchmarks has kept the state of the art in a state of ambiguity. Saber signals a new and promising maturity.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-gif-maker201.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Machine putting sauce on pizza dough\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"automation%E2%80%99s-frontier-fast-food\">Automation’s Frontier: Fast Food</h2><p>Quick-service restaurants are experiencing record-high employee turnover, while labor advocates are pushing for higher wages. Some experts say these forces are propelling the fast food industry toward full automation.</p><p><strong>Who’s already automating:</strong> The move to put fast food under machine control is already in high gear:</p><ul><li>McDonalds announced on Tuesday its acquisition of Apprente, a company that develops voice-driven conversational agents.

Humans place toppings.</li><li>At Spyce in Boston, customers order and pay by kiosk, and a machine mixes their grain-based meals. Human prep cooks par-bake rice, chop veggies, and reduce sauces.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong>  Humans are opting out for the quick-service business. In July, the CEO of Panera Bread told CNBC’s @Work conference that his company experienced nearly <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/29/fast-food-restaurants-in-america-are-losing-100percent-of-workers-every-year.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">100 percent annual employee turnover</a>  — and this number was low for the industry.

A 2017 report by the National Council on Compensation Insurance found that, while automation historically <a href=\"https://www.ncci.com/Articles/Pages/II_Insights_QEB_Impact-Automation-Employment-Q2-2017-Part1.aspx?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">replaces human labor</a>, the jobs that remain tend to be higher skilled and <a href=\"https://www.ncci.com/Articles/Pages/II_Insights_QEB_Impact-Automation-Employment-Q3-2017-Part2.aspx?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">better compensated</a>.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>  Apps and kiosks are clearly capable of replacing fast-food customer service.
