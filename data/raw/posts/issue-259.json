In this letter, I’d like to share what might be a counter-intuitive best practice that I’ve learned from leading <a href=\"http://aifund.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><u>AI Fund</u></a>, a venture studio that has built dozens of startups with extraordinary entrepreneurs. When it comes to building AI applications, we strongly prefer to work on a <em>concrete idea</em>, meaning a specific product envisioned in enough detail that we can build it for a specific target user.&nbsp;</p><p>Some design philosophies say you shouldn’t envision a specific product from the start. Instead, they recommend starting with a problem to be solved and then carefully studying the market before you devise a concrete solution. There’s a reason for this: The more concrete or precise your product specification, the more likely it is to be off-target. However, I find that having something specific to execute toward lets you go much faster and discover and fix problems more rapidly along the way. If the idea turns out to be flawed, rapid execution will let you discover the flaws sooner, and this knowledge and experience will help you switch to a different concrete idea.</p><p>One test of concreteness is whether you’ve specified the idea in enough detail that a product/engineering team could build an initial prototype. For example, “AI for livestock farming” is not concrete; it’s vague. If you were to ask an engineer to build this, they would have a hard time knowing what to build.&nbsp; Similarly, “AI for livestock tracking in farming” is still vague. There are so many approaches to this that most reasonable engineers wouldn’t know what to build. But “Apply face recognition to cows so as to recognize individual cows and monitor their movement on a farm” is specific enough that a good engineer could quickly choose from the available options (for example, what algorithm to try first, what camera resolution to use, and so on) to let us relatively efficiently assess:</p><ul><li><strong>Technical feasibility:</strong> For example, do face recognition algorithms developed for human faces work for cows? (It turns out that they do!)&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Business feasibility:</strong> Does the idea add enough value to be worth building? (Talking to farmers might quickly reveal that solutions like RFID are easier and cheaper.)</li></ul><p>Articulating a concrete idea — which is more likely than a vague idea to be wrong — takes more courage. The more specific an idea, the more likely it is to be a bit off, especially in the details. The general area of AI for livestock farming seems promising, and surely there will be good ways to apply AI for livestock. In contrast, specifying a concrete idea, which is much easier to invalidate, is scary.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--75--1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/unnamed--75--1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/unnamed--75--1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--75--1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>The benefit is that the clarity of a specific product vision lets a team execute much faster. One strong predictor of how likely a startup is to succeed is the speed with which it can get stuff done. This is why founders with clarity of vision tend to be desired; clarity helps drive a team in a specific direction. Of course, the vision has to be a good one, and there’s always a risk of efficiently building something that no one wants to buy! But a startup is unlikely to succeed if it meanders for too long without forming a clear, concrete vision.</p><p>Building toward something concrete — if you can do so in a responsible way that doesn’t harm others — lets you get critical feedback more efficiently and, if necessary, switch directions sooner. (See my <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-to-build-ai-products-and-businesses-two-strategies?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><u>letter</u></a> on when it’s better to go with a “Ready, Fire, Aim” approach to projects.) One factor that favors this approach is the low cost of experimenting and iterating. This is increasingly the case for many AI applications, but perhaps less so for deep-tech AI projects.&nbsp;</p><p>I realize that this advice runs counter to common practice in <a href=\"https://wind4change.com/design-thinking-d-school-stanford-ideo-approach-methodology/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><u>design thinking</u></a>, which warns against leaping to a solution too quickly, and instead advocates spending time understanding end-users, deeply understanding their problems, and brainstorming a wide range of solutions. If you’re starting without any ideas, then such an extended process can be a good way to develop good ideas. Further, keeping ideas open-ended can be good for curiosity-driven research, where investing to pursue deep tech with only a vague direction in mind can pay huge dividends over the long term.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are thinking about starting a new AI project, consider whether you can come up with a concrete vision to execute toward. Even if the initial vision turns out not to be quite right, rapid iteration will let you discover this sooner, and the learnings will let you switch to a different concrete idea.&nbsp;</p><p>Through working with many large corporations, AI Fund has developed best practices for identifying concrete ideas relevant to a business. I’ll share more on this in a later letter.</p><p>Keep learning!</p><p>Andrew&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/intro-to-federated-learning?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-07-23T084952.204.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-07-23T084952.204.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-07-23T084952.204.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-07-23T084952.204.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-07-23T084952.204.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Learn how to build secure, privacy-focused federated learning systems using the Flower framework in a new two-part short course.

It newly underpins the free version of ChatGPT.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> GPT-4o mini currently accepts text and image inputs and outputs text. Image output as well as video and audio input/output are coming soon. OpenAI did not provide information about its architecture or training but <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/18/openai-unveils-gpt-4o-mini-a-small-ai-model-powering-chatgpt/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><u>told</u></a> <em>TechCrunch</em> it’s roughly the size of Claude 3 Haiku, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and the 8-billion-parameter version of Llama 3. It has a context window of 128,000 tokens and can output up to around 16,400 tokens.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>API access to GPT-4o mini, which <a href=\"https://openai.com/api/pricing/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><u>costs</u></a> $0.15/$0.60 per 1 million input/output tokens. That’s significantly less than the more capable GPT-4o ($5/$15 per 1 million input/output tokens with the same context window). It’s also more cost-effective and significantly better performing than GPT-3.5 Turbo ($0.50/$1.50 per 1 million input/output tokens with a 16,000-token context window).</li><li>On the <a href=\"https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mmlu?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><u>MMLU</u></a> language understanding benchmark, GPT-4o mini beats Gemini 1.5 Flash at a lower cost, according to tests by <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/gpt-4o-mini?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><u>Artificial Analysis</u></a>. It’s just behind Llama 3 70B and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12387?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><u>Reka Core</u></a> but costs around half as much as the former and 1/20th as much as the latter.</li><li>GPT-4o mini (which generates 108 tokens per second) is slower than Llama 3 8B (166 tokens per second), Gemini 1.5 Flash (148 tokens per second), and Claude 3 Haiku (127 tokens per second) according to Artificial Analysis. However, GPT-4o mini speeds past GPT-4o, which produces 63 tokens per second.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> GPT-4o mini part of a July wave of smaller large language models.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Mistral and Nvidia jointly <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-nemo/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><u>released</u></a> Mistral NeMo (12 billion parameters). Its context window is 128,000 tokens, equal to GPT-4o mini and larger than most models of its size. It’s available under the Apache 2.0 open source license.</li><li>Hugging Face <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/smollm?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><u>debuted</u></a> SmolLM, a family of three even smaller models — 135 million, 362 million, and 1.71 billion parameters — designed to run on mobile devices. The base and instruction-tuned versions including weights are freely available for download with no restrictions on commercial use. SmolLM is licensed under Apache 2.0.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Powerful multimodal models are becoming ever more widely available at lower prices, creating opportunities for developers and researchers alike. GPT-4o mini sets a new standard for others to beat. Its price may be especially appealing to developers who aim to build agentic workflows that require models to process large numbers of tokens on their way to producing output.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Not long ago, pushing the edge of large language models meant making them larger, with higher computing costs to drive rising parameter counts. But building bigger models has made it easier to develop smaller models that are more cost-effective and nearly as capable. It’s a virtuous circle: Costs fall and productivity rises to everyone’s benefit.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--76-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/unnamed--76-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/unnamed--76-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--76-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"meta-withholds-models-from-europe\">M<strong>eta Withholds Models From Europe</strong></h1><p>European users won’t have access to Meta’s multimodal models.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Meta said it would <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/17/meta-future-multimodal-ai-models-eu?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><u>withhold</u></a> future multimodal models from the European Union (EU) to avoid being charged, banned, or fined for running afoul of the region’s privacy laws, according to Axios.

By learning to represent an image via separate embeddings for facial expression and head position — which change — as well as for facial structure in its 2D and 3D aspects — which don’t — a latent diffusion model can focus on the parts of the image that matter most.

Given the embeddings, the decoder reconstructed the image. The authors trained the encoders and decoder together using eight loss terms.
