I'd like to share a few observations from that presentation, and I invite you to watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p248yoa3oE&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8a7HWE1teFmWBtzowT9QfcxxnBSVHqnRKkp-usBKpxrl5F5uZ4gPAQzmmOCqPb4ynKDUz1\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> (37 minutes).</em></p><p><em>AI is a collection of tools, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and now generative AI. All of these are general-purpose technologies, meaning that — similar to other general-purpose technologies like electricity and the internet — they are useful for many different tasks. It took many years after deep learning started to work really well circa 2010 to identify and build for a wide range of use cases such as online advertising, medical diagnosis, driver assistance, and shipping optimization. We’re still a long way from fully exploiting supervised learning.</em></p><p><em>Now that we have added generative AI to our toolbox, it will take years more to explore all its uses. (If you want to learn how to build applications using generative AI, please check out our <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">short courses</a>!)</em></p><p><em>Where do the opportunities lie? With each new wave of technology, entrepreneurs and investors focus a lot of attention on providers of infrastructure and tools for developers. The generative AI wave has brought tools from AWS, Google Cloud, Hugging Face, Langchain, Microsoft, OpenAI, and many more. Some will be huge winners in this area. However, the sheer amount of attention makes this part of the AI stack hypercompetitive. My teams (specifically AI Fund) build startups in infrastructure and tools only when we think we have a significant technology advantage, because that gives us a shot at building large, sustainable businesses.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/09/unnamed--55-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/unnamed--55-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/unnamed--55-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/09/unnamed--55-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>But I believe a bigger opportunity lies in the application layer. Indeed, for the companies that provide infrastructure and developer tools to do well, the application companies that use these products must perform even better. After all, the application companies need to generate enough revenue to pay the tool builders.</em></p><p><em>For example, AI Fund portfolio companies are applying AI to applications as diverse as <a href=\"https://aifund.ai/portfolio/bearing-ai/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8a7HWE1teFmWBtzowT9QfcxxnBSVHqnRKkp-usBKpxrl5F5uZ4gPAQzmmOCqPb4ynKDUz1\" rel=\"noopener\">global maritime shipping</a> and <a href=\"https://aifund.ai/portfolio/amorai/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8a7HWE1teFmWBtzowT9QfcxxnBSVHqnRKkp-usBKpxrl5F5uZ4gPAQzmmOCqPb4ynKDUz1\" rel=\"noopener\">relationship mentoring</a>. These are just two areas where the general-purpose technology of AI can create enormous value. Because few teams have expertise in both AI and sectors like shipping or relationships, the competition is much less intense.</em></p><p><em>If you’re interested in building valuable AI projects, I think you’ll find the ideas in the presentation useful.

The policy doesn’t explicitly mention generative AI, which can automate production of misleading ads.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> In certain countries, Google accepts election-related ads only from advertisers that pass a lengthy verification process.

AI rendered the clips, originally recorded in Hindi, in Haryanvi and English, and a generative adversarial network conformed the candidate’s lip movements to the generated languages. In the context of Google’s requirements, the translated clips made it appear as though the candidate had done something he didn’t do.</li><li>In January 2023, China’s internet watchdog <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/chinas-new-law-limits-ai-generated-media/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">issued</a> new rules that similarly require generated media to bear a clear label if it might mislead an audience into believing false information.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but: </strong>The rules’ narrow focus on inauthentic depictions of real people or events may leave room for misleading generated imagery. For instance, a U.S. Republican Party <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/us-republicans-released-the-first-ai-generated-attack-ad/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">video</a> contains generated images of a fictional dystopian future stemming from Joe Biden’s hypothetical re-election in 2024. The images don’t depict real events, so they may not require clear labeling under Google’s new policy.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Digital disinformation has influenced elections for years, and the rise of generative AI <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/disinformation-groups-used-ai-to-spread-propaganda/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">gives</a> manipulators a new toolbox. Google, which delivers an enormous quantity of advertising via Search, YouTube, and the web at large, is a powerful vector for untruths and propaganda. With its new rules, the company will assume the role of regulating itself in an environment where few governments have enacted restrictions.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Kudos to Google for setting standards for political ads, generated or otherwise. The rules leave some room for interpretation; for instance, does a particular image depict a real event inauthentically or simply depict a fictional one? On the other hand, if Google enforces the policy, it’s likely to reduce disinformation.

ConvNeXt V2 improves upon <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8a7HWE1teFmWBtzowT9QfcxxnBSVHqnRKkp-usBKpxrl5F5uZ4gPAQzmmOCqPb4ynKDUz1\" rel=\"noopener\">ConvNeXt</a>, which updated the classic <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8a7HWE1teFmWBtzowT9QfcxxnBSVHqnRKkp-usBKpxrl5F5uZ4gPAQzmmOCqPb4ynKDUz1\" rel=\"noopener\">ResNet</a>.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Vision transformers learn via masked pretraining — that is, hiding part of an image and learning to reconstruct the missing part. This enables them to learn from unlabeled data, which simplifies amassing large training datasets and thus enables them to produce better embeddings. If masked pretraining works for transformers, it ought to work for CNNs as well.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> ConvNeXt V2 is an encoder-decoder pretrained on 14 million images in <a href=\"https://www.image-net.org/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8a7HWE1teFmWBtzowT9QfcxxnBSVHqnRKkp-usBKpxrl5F5uZ4gPAQzmmOCqPb4ynKDUz1\" rel=\"noopener\">ImageNet 22k</a>. For the decoder, the authors used a single ConvNeXt convolutional block (made up of three convolutional layers). They modified the ConvNeXt encoder (36 ConvNeXt blocks) as follows:</p><ul><li>The authors removed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17239?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8a7HWE1teFmWBtzowT9QfcxxnBSVHqnRKkp-usBKpxrl5F5uZ4gPAQzmmOCqPb4ynKDUz1\" rel=\"noopener\">LayerScale</a> from each ConvNeXt block. In ConvNeXt, this operation learned how much to scale each layer’s output, but in ConvNeXt V2, it didn’t improve performance.</li><li>They added to each block a scaling operation called global response normalization (GRN). A block’s intermediate layer generated an embedding with 384 values, known as channels. GRN scaled each channel based on its magnitude relative to the magnitude of all channels combined. This scaling narrowed the range of channel activation values, which prevented feature collapse, a problem with ConvNeXt in which channels with small weights don’t contribute to the output.</li><li>During pretraining, ConvNeXt V2 split each input image into a 32x32 grid and masked random grid squares. Given the masked image, the encoder learned to produce an embedding. Given the embedding, the decoder learned to reproduce the unmasked image.</li><li>After pretraining, the authors fine-tuned the encoder to classify images using 1.28 million images from ImageNet 1k.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The biggest ConvNeXt V2 model (659 million parameters) achieved 88.9 percent top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. The previous state of the art, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11227?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8a7HWE1teFmWBtzowT9QfcxxnBSVHqnRKkp-usBKpxrl5F5uZ4gPAQzmmOCqPb4ynKDUz1\" rel=\"noopener\">MViTV2</a> (a transformer with roughly the same number of parameters) achieved 88.8 percent accuracy. In addition, ConvNeXt V2 required less processing power: 600.7 gigaflops versus 763.5 gigaflops.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Transformers show great promise in computer vision, but convolutional architectures can achieve comparable performance with less computation.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> While ImageNet 22k is one of the largest publicly available image datasets, vision transformers benefit from training on proprietary datasets that are much larger. We’re eager to see how ConvNeXt V2 would fare if it were scaled to billions of parameters and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04560v2?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8a7HWE1teFmWBtzowT9QfcxxnBSVHqnRKkp-usBKpxrl5F5uZ4gPAQzmmOCqPb4ynKDUz1\" rel=\"noopener\">images</a>. In addition, ImageNet has been joined by many newer benchmarks. We’d like to see results for some of those.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong>Australia bans AI-generated depictions of child abuse from search engines</strong><br>Australia's eSafety Commissioner required search engines including Google and DuckDuckGo to remove synthetic child abuse material from their results.
