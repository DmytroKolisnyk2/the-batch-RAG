But the company’s management rejected or weakened proposed reforms, concerned that such changes might cut into profits or give the appearance of muzzling conservatives. <br><br><strong>Fizzled reforms:</strong> Facebook’s recommender system promotes posts from its most active users: those who do the most commenting, sharing, and liking. Internal investigations conducted between 2016 and 2018 showed that such so-called superusers disproportionately spread misinformation, much of it politically divisive. Internal committees proposed ways to address the issue, but the company ultimately made changes that blunted their potential impact.</p><ul><li>One proposal called for lowering recommendation scores for content posted by superusers on the far right or far left of the political spectrum. Content from moderates would receive higher scores.</li><li>The company accepted the approach but lowered the penalties applied to extremist posts by 80 percent.</li><li>Facebook also nixed the building of a classification system for polarizing content and quashed plans to suppress political clickbait.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Conservatives in the U.S. have long accused social media platforms of left-wing bias, a charge to which Facebook has been particularly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/14/facebook-zuckerberg-conservatives-private-meetings-046663?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">sensitive</a>.</p><ul><li>In 2018, lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17225120/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-congress-cruz-blackburn-diamond-silk?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">grilled</a> Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over accusations that the platform marginalized conservatives.</li><li>Last week, Twitter put warning labels on tweets by Donald Trump that it deemed misleading or inciting violence. The president responded with an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273822/trump-signs-executive-order-facebook-twitter-section-230-social-media-companies?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">executive order</a> that would strip social media companies of legal protections from liability for content posted by users.</li><li>Facebook publishes similarly inflammatory posts by the president without challenge. Some Facebook employees protested that stance with a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">virtual walkout</a> on Monday.</li></ul><p><strong>Facebook’s response:</strong> “We’ve built a robust integrity team, strengthened our policies and practices to limit harmful content, and used research to understand our platform’s impact on society so we continue to improve,” the company said in a statement.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The algorithms that govern popular social media platforms have an outsized influence on political discourse worldwide, contributing to polarization, unrest, and hate crimes. Divisive rhetoric distributed by Facebook has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/technology/facebook-to-remove-misinformation-that-leads-to-violence.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">linked</a> to violence in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and India.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Social media is a double-edged sword. It has been helpful for quickly disseminating (mostly accurate) information about concerns like Covid-19. But what brings people together can also drive them apart. The AI community has a responsibility to craft algorithms that support a just society even as they promote business.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SHORTCUT.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Data and information related to shortcut learning\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"when-models-take-shortcuts\">When Models Take Shortcuts</h2><p>Neuroscientists once thought they could train rats to navigate mazes by color. It turns out that rats don’t perceive colors at all. Instead, they rely on the distinct odors of different colors of paint. New work finds that neural networks are especially prone to this sort of misalignment between training goals and learning.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Robert Geirhos, Jörn-Henrik Jacobsen, and Claudios Michaelis led a study of neural network hiccups conducted by the University of Tübingen, Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems, and the University of Toronto. They argue that many of deep learning’s shortcomings reveal <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07780?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">shortcut learning</a>.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Shortcuts are pathways to solving a problem that result in good performance on standard benchmarks but don’t require understanding of the problem and therefore don’t transfer well to real-world situations.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors identify apparent causes of shortcut learning in neural networks, circumstances that tend to encourage it, and techniques available to discourage it.</p><ul><li>Dataset bias can cause models to focus on <a href=\"https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">spurious correlations</a> rather than valid relationships. For instance, cows often stand in pastures, so black, white, and green textures can indicate their presence — but a lawn is not an identifying mark of cattle. Models have a hard time learning true bovine characteristics when their training data offers this simpler approach.</li><li>Training data may be free of spurious correlations and still fail to represent the task at hand. For example, cats have fur while elephants have wrinkled skin, so an animal classifier may wind up becoming a texture detector instead.</li><li>To address such issues, the authors propose training and testing on out-of-distribution, augmented, and adversarial examples. If a model incorrectly recognizes a test sample that has been altered to change, say, the color of grass from green to brown, it’s likely the model relied on shortcuts.</li><li>In the animal classification tasks described above, domain experts can make sure the training set depicts animals in a variety of scenes and breeds such as hairless cats that exhibit a range of textures.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The authors shed light on an issue that has troubled machine learning engineers for decades and highlight the lack of robustness of current algorithms. Addressing these issues will be key to scaling up practical neural network deployments.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Humans also use shortcuts; we’ve all memorized formulas by rote instead of fully understanding them. Our misbehaving models may be more like us than we’d like to admit.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Dishes2-optimized.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Dishwashing robot working\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"ai-does-the-dishes\">AI Does the Dishes</h2><p>A pioneer in dishwashing robots is reaching into commercial kitchens.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Dishcraft Robotics uses machines equipped with computer vision to scrub dirties for corporate food services and, soon, restaurants.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Every morning, Dishcraft’s biodiesel-fueled trucks deliver clean dishes and utensils to corporate clients near its Silicon Valley hub. At the day’s end, the trucks retrieve them.

The authors prioritized newer techniques that improve accuracy without impinging on speed (their so-called “bag of freebies”). In addition, they made improvements that boost accuracy at a minimal cost to speed (the “bag of specials”). All told, these tweaks enable the new version to outperform both its predecessor and high-accuracy competitors running at real-time frame rates.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> YOLO, as well as most object detectors since, tack a model that predicts bounding boxes and classes onto a pre-trained ImageNet feature extractor.</p><ul><li>Techniques under the heading “bag of freebies” boost accuracy by adding computation during training.
