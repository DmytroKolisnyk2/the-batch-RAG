Timnit is a tireless champion of diversity and fairness in AI. Her work, for example highlighting bias in face recognition systems, has been a productive influence on many researchers and companies. At the same time, my friend Jeff Dean built Google AI into a world-class engineering organization. I’ve seen him speak up for diversity when no one else in the room was doing so.</em></p><p><em>Having not yet spoken to either of them, I hesitate to offer my opinion on the matter at this time.

Many companies and think tanks have published their own codes of ethics, and these statements are important — but they are far from sufficient. We need a set of values and norms that are shared across our entire community and transcend any one company. That way, we can collectively hold individuals, companies, and perhaps even governments accountable to them and operate for the common good even when we disagree.</em></p><p><em>How can we bring the AI community together around shared values and norms? I encourage you to spend time with your teams, collaborators, and peers to discuss this difficult question.

The new algorithm controls Loon’s fleet over Kenya, where the company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21811123/alphabet-loon-internet-balloons-ai-machine-learning-pilot?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">launched</a> its first commercial service in July.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> Balloons navigate by ascending or descending to catch winds that push them in the direction desired. Loon used <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10044?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">QR-DQN</a>, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm, to train a feed-forward network to determine when the balloon should ascend, descend, or stay put.</p><ul><li>Working with Google AI’s Montreal team, Loon researchers modified a weather dataset from the <a href=\"https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/qj.3803?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts</a> to generate a large number of wind scenarios.

The reward halved with every 100 kilometers the balloon strayed.</li><li>In use, instruments on board feed the model wind readings from the balloon’s current location and wake. It estimates wind conditions at nearby locations using a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Gaussian process</a> that analyzes weather readings from nearby balloons and forecasts from the <a href=\"https://www.ecmwf.int/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts</a>.

A single balloon can serve several thousand individuals spread over 80 square kilometers.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Billions of people, including <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/two-thirds-worlds-school-age-children-have-no-internet-access-home-new-unicef-itu?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">two-thirds</a> of all school-age children, don’t have access to the internet.

A new study drills down on issues of scale, showing that such models might learn the approximate weight of a dog or cost of an apple, at least to the right order of magnitude.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Xikun Zhang and Deepak Ramachandran with colleagues at Stanford, Google, AI2 Israel, Bar Ilan University, and University of Pennsylvania probed whether word embeddings produced by pretrained models encode knowledge of objects’ mass, length, or price.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Pretrained features that represent words may or may not capture scale-bound attributes. To find out, the authors built simple linear models that took the pretrained embeddings as a starting point and trained them on a dataset that explicitly associates words with such attributes. If the models learned to estimate such attributes, they reasoned, then the pretrained embeddings did, indeed, represent them.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors analyzed features generated by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ELMo</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">BERT</a>, whose embeddings vary depending on context, as well as the earlier <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">word2vec</a>, a fixed set of embeddings. They also tested features generated by their own model, NumBERT, which is identical to BERT except that numerals in its pretraining data were replaced by the same numbers in scientific notation.</p><ul><li>The researchers built two linear models that accepted embeddings from each language model. One linear model used regression to produce a median estimate of mass, length, or price. The other produced a distribution of probabilities among 12 orders of magnitude.</li><li>Freezing the language models’ weights, the researchers trained the linear models on the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01327?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Distribution over Quantities</a> (DoQ) dataset, which contains nouns and distributions of their masses, lengths, and prices.</li><li>They fed the language models sentences like “The dog is heavy” or “The ring is expensive,” and passed the embeddings of the key word (here, “dog” or “ring”) to the linear models to produce an estimate or distribution.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The linear models matched the DoQ measures with greater-than-random accuracy. Those that used embeddings from ELMo, BERT, and NumBERT produced better performance than those that used word2vec. To evaluate whether the linear models generalized beyond DoQ, the authors tested them on <a href=\"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1025.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">comparing sizes and weights</a> between pairs of objects. The regression model that used NumBERT embeddings achieved accuracy of 0.76, outperforming BERT (0.71), ELMo (0.72), and word2vec (0.74).
