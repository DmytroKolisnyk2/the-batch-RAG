Unfortunately they succeeded: Now many people think AI is scary. But when I speak with regulators, media, and private citizens, I like to bring the issue of whether AI is beneficial or harmful back to a very basic question: Are we better off with more, or less, intelligence in the world?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Intelligence is the ability to apply skills and knowledge to make good decisions. Yes, intelligence can be used for nefarious purposes. But over many centuries, a major driver of civilization's progress has been people getting smarter and more educated.

That's why it’s so expensive to hire intelligence, such as a highly skilled doctor to examine and advise you on a medical condition, or a patient tutor who can understand your child and gently coach them where they need help. But with artificial intelligence, we have the potential to make intelligence cheap for everyone, so you no longer have to worry about a huge bill for seeing a doctor or educating your child.&nbsp;</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/unnamed--95--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Andrew Ng speaking at TED AI, October 17, 2023\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/unnamed--95--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/unnamed--95--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/unnamed--95--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>For society's biggest problems, such as climate change, intelligence — including artificial intelligence — also has a significant role to play.

Check out our new short course on “Building Applications with Vector Databases,” taught by Pinecone’s Tim Tully! Vector databases (DBs) are commonly associated with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) but actually have many uses in AI applications. In this course, you’ll learn about (i) a basic semantic search app that uses a vector DB to find similar documents, (ii) a RAG application querying datasets it was not trained on, (iii) recommender systems that combine semantic search and RAG, (iv) hybrid search, which lets you work with dense and sparse vectors simultaneously, (v) anomaly detection applied to network logs, and (vi) an image-similarity application with a fun example that determines which parent a child resembles more. Come learn how you can use vector DBs to build many different types of applications!&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVHq6H6TMxM9W8TV7CF5FvPH4W20x2Jc58Zt8WN8wLL6q3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3pKVQv-FK6CXVFLW5yNf5J7XtWVFW32hqkv3z_GSKW5Vrf077Gwm7XW9616wV65JTYjVKWbx-5gkBzGW7JbKMb91ljfBN1zK_6JJ0HXBW9gNydX7RFTXpW587Qwr6mvG_1W86RRt82xcYWbN8jss88Txf9PW52-Fw26r_y54W840Ddf1DMLbyW7qslFw3Z9jlPW1CBJ9f2ZDwSVVhNzFw7MP1hrW57VVWN2BZCmDW6f6qR2468d9MW65cPWp2nyGkJW7td37h61xY7tW63b6H35TD8YRW2qSjYn7_VjfTW8YWt917FrC5JW6wCXdB86rGQRW6vBjsz5lnycrW2nSCMw2NbWWGW8wFB0D2kdLL8f25P8wT04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Enroll here</em></a></p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/unnamed---2024-01-31T154407.087.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/unnamed---2024-01-31T154407.087.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/unnamed---2024-01-31T154407.087.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/unnamed---2024-01-31T154407.087.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"resources-for-research\">Resources for Research</h1><p>The United States government wants to connect U.S. AI researchers with resources that can help them develop their projects.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;The National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nairrpilot.org/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zTtLWq1ZZMZAC_cWYWLP26YekgIae7-rD1jeLN-16XAUnZ5tsiSJ2ylZ5S-ia9AnpH2ZJ\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a>&nbsp;the first call for proposals in its pilot program, which will accept applications through March 1.

They also calculated the percentage of each state’s total jobs that required AI skills for both dates.</p><ul><li>California continues to post the most U.S. AI jobs. However, California’s share of AI jobs dipped from 26 percent in 2018 to 19 percent in 2023. Still, 1.07 percent of postings in California are AI jobs, well above the national average of 0.56 percent.</li><li>Similarly, the share of AI jobs in the state of Washington, home to Amazon and Microsoft, declined from 13 percent in 2018 to 5 percent in 2023. However, more than 1 percent of Washington postings are AI jobs.</li><li>The combined share of Maryland, Virginia, and Washington D.C. — the U.S. capital region — rose from 7 percent in 2018 to 13 percent in 2023. The authors attributed this growth to the federal government’s embrace of AI: Companies that supply the government have responded by hiring AI experts.</li><li>New York’s and New Jersey’s combined share of AI jobs declined from approximately 12 percent in 2018 to 11 percent in 2023.</li><li>Meanwhile, other parts of the U.S. saw meaningful growth. Texas’ share of AI jobs grew from 6 percent of AI jobs in 2018 to over 8 percent in 2023. Florida’s share rose from 2 to 4 percent in the same time period. The combined share of 12 Midwestern states grew from 10 percent to 13 percent. However, these regions posted much smaller percentages of AI jobs relative to total jobs.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong>&nbsp;A 2021 Brookings&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ai-hubs-are-few-and-far-between/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zTtLWq1ZZMZAC_cWYWLP26YekgIae7-rD1jeLN-16XAUnZ5tsiSJ2ylZ5S-ia9AnpH2ZJ\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a>&nbsp;on U.S. AI jobs focused on metropolitan areas and analyzed not only job postings but also federal grants, research papers, patent filings, and companies. Despite the differences in methodology, it agreed with the new report that investment was driving AI growth outside of the Bay Area. The new report suggests a much wider geographical distribution of AI jobs in 2024 than in 2021. It appears some of the then-emerging industrial investment in AI is bearing fruit.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;For people who aim to make a career in AI, this report contains double good news: (i) Established AI hubs in the U.S. still host the most new openings and (ii) AI jobs are growing far and wide! As the industry becomes more dispersed geographically, AI builders have more options, organizations can select from a more diverse talent pool, and the technology’s benefits can be shared more broadly.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Although this report focused on the U.S., we believe that growth in AI jobs is a global trend. One contributor is growing acceptance of remote work (which remains more prevalent than it was a few years ago despite its decline as the Covid pandemic has wanted). This means more AI opportunities for everyone, everywhere!&nbsp;</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/unnamed---2024-01-31T155118.727.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"335\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/unnamed---2024-01-31T155118.727.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"more-consistent-generated-videos\">More Consistent Generated Videos</h1><p>Text-to-video has struggled to produce consistent motions like walking and rotation. A new approach achieves more realistic motion.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;Omer Bar-Tal, Hila Chefer, Omer Tov, and colleagues at Google, Weizmann Institute, Tel-Aviv University, and Technion built&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12945?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zTtLWq1ZZMZAC_cWYWLP26YekgIae7-rD1jeLN-16XAUnZ5tsiSJ2ylZ5S-ia9AnpH2ZJ\" rel=\"noopener\">Lumiere</a>, a system that simplifies the usual process of generating video with improved results. You can see examples of its output&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lumiere-video.github.io/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zTtLWq1ZZMZAC_cWYWLP26YekgIae7-rD1jeLN-16XAUnZ5tsiSJ2ylZ5S-ia9AnpH2ZJ\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;Most text-to-video generators economize on memory use through a staged process: One model generates a few frames per second, another model generates additional frames between the initial ones, and a third generates a higher resolution version of every frame. Generating in-between frames can make repetitive motions inconsistent. To avoid these inconsistencies, the authors generated all frames at the same time. To bring down memory requirements, the video generator reduced the size of the video embedding before intensive processing and then restored their original size.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;Lumiere borrows two components from previous work. It uses a frozen, pretrained text-to-image diffusion model (in this case,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zTtLWq1ZZMZAC_cWYWLP26YekgIae7-rD1jeLN-16XAUnZ5tsiSJ2ylZ5S-ia9AnpH2ZJ\" rel=\"noopener\">Imagen</a>, with additional convolutional and attention layers) to generate low-resolution video frames from a text description. It uses a super-resolution model (unspecified in this case) to boost the frames’ resolution. The authors trained the layers added to Imagen on an unspecified dataset of 30 million videos (16 frames per second, 128x128 pixels per frame) and their captions.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Given a 5-second video with added noise and its text caption, the layers added to Imagen learned to remove the noise. Following earlier&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02303?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zTtLWq1ZZMZAC_cWYWLP26YekgIae7-rD1jeLN-16XAUnZ5tsiSJ2ylZ5S-ia9AnpH2ZJ\" rel=\"noopener\">work</a>, the model saved memory by shrinking video embeddings spatially. Specifically, additional convolutional layers progressively shrank the input embedding from size (Time, Height, Width, Depth) to size (Time, Height/2, Width/2, Depth). This effectively shrank the parts of the embedding that correspond to individual frames before subjecting the entire embedding to computationally intensive attention layers. Afterward, further convolutional layers enlarged the embeddings to match the input size.</li><li>In addition to shrinking and enlarging the video embedding spatially, the added layers learned to shrink and enlarge it temporally; that is, from size (Time, Height, Width, Depth) to size (Time/2, Height/2, Width/2, Depth). This further economized on memory usage.</li><li>To accommodate the super-resolution model, Lumiere broke up Imagen’s 5-second video output into overlapping clips. The super-resolution model increased their resolution to 1024×1024.</li><li>To avoid temporal artifacts from this process, Lumiere employed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08113?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zTtLWq1ZZMZAC_cWYWLP26YekgIae7-rD1jeLN-16XAUnZ5tsiSJ2ylZ5S-ia9AnpH2ZJ\" rel=\"noopener\">MultiDiffusion</a>, which learned a weighted sum over the overlapping portions of the clips.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;Given one video produced by Lumiere and another produced by a competitor (AnimateDiff, Gen2, Imagen Video, Pika, or ZeroScope), judges compared video quality and alignment with the text prompt used to generate a video. For each competitor, they evaluated 400 videos for each of 113 prompts. Comparing video quality, Lumiere beat the best competitor, Gen2, 61 percent to 39 percent. Comparing alignment with the prompt, Lumiere beat the best competitor, ImagenVideo, 55 percent to 45 percent.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Earlier video generators produced output with limited motion or motion with noticeable issues (for example, a character’s body shape might change in unexpected ways). By producing all video frames at once, Lumiere generates images of motion without such issues.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Lumiere's approach hints at both the challenge of generating video and the pace of development. Many further refinements are needed to make such systems as useful as, say, ChatGPT, but recent progress is impressive.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\"><a
