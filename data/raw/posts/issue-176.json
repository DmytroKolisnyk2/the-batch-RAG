The latest efforts adapt ViTs to new tasks and address their shortcomings.</p><ul><li>ViTs learn best from immense quantities of data, so researchers at Meta and Sorbonne University concentrated on <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/a-formula-for-training-vision-transformers/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">improving performance on datasets of (merely) millions of examples</a>.

The ViT’s strength lies in its ability to consider relationships between all pixels in an image at small and at large scales. One downside is that it needs additional training to learn in ways that are baked into the CNN architecture after random initialization. CNN’s local context window (within which only local pixels matter) and weight sharing (which enables it to process different image locations identically) help transformers to learn more from less data.</p><p><strong>Where things stand: </strong>The past year expanded the Vision Transformer’s scope in a number of applications.

Researchers worked to make their output more trustworthy and less inflammatory.</p><ul><li>In late 2021, DeepMind proposed <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/large-language-models-shrink/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">RETRO</a>, a model that retrieves passages from the MassiveText dataset and integrates them into its output.</li><li>AI21 Labs' spring launch of <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/neural-nets-rules-truer-text/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Jurassic-X</a> introduced a suite of modules — including a calculator and a system that queries Wikipedia — to fact-check a language model’s answers to math problems, historical facts, and the like.</li><li>Researchers at Stanford and École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne created <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/update-any-language-model/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">SERAC</a>, a system that updates language models with new information without retraining them. A separate system stores new data and learns to provide output to queries that are relevant to that data.</li><li>Meta built <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-small-language-models-can-perform-specialized-tasks/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Atlas</a>, a language model that answer questions by retrieving information from a database of documents. Published in August, this approach enabled an 11 billion-parameter Atlas to outperform a 540 billion-parameter PaLM at answering questions.</li><li>Late in the year, OpenAI fine-tuned <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-ai-professionals-reacted-to-chatgpt-on-twitter/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">ChatGPT</a> to minimize untruthful, biased, or harmful output. Humans ranked the quality of the model’s training data, then a reinforcement learning algorithm rewarded the model for generating outputs similar to those ranked highly.</li><li>Such developments intensified the need for language benchmarks that evaluate more varied and subtle capabilities. Answering the call, more than 130 institutions collaborated on <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/toward-next-gen-language-models/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">BIG-bench</a>, which includes tasks like deducing a movie title from emojis, participating in mock trials, and detecting logical fallacies.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Amid the progress came a few notable stumbles. The public demo Meta’s Galactica, a language model trained to generate text on scientific and technical subjects, lasted three days in November before its developers pulled the plug due to its propensity to generate falsehoods and cite nonexistent sources. In August, the chatbot BlenderBot 3, also from Meta, quickly gained a reputation for spouting racist stereotypes and conspiracy theories.</p><p><strong>Where things stand: </strong>The toolbox of truth and decency in text generation grew substantially in the past year. Successful techniques will find their way into future waves of blockbuster models.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/ezgif.com-gif-maker--6-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Illustration of three deers doing holiday household chores: washing a champagne flute, cooking pie and wrapping a gift\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/ezgif.com-gif-maker--6-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/ezgif.com-gif-maker--6-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/ezgif.com-gif-maker--6-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"one-model-does-it-all\">One Model Does It All</h1><p>Individual deep learning models proved their mettle in hundreds of tasks.<br><br><strong>What happened:</strong> The scope of multi-task models expanded dramatically in the past year.</p><p><strong>Driving the story: </strong>Researchers pushed the limits of how many different skills a neural network can learn. They were inspired by the emergent skills of large language models — say, the ability to compose poetry and write computer programs without architectural tuning for either — as well as the capacity of models trained on both text and images to find correspondences between the disparate data types.</p><ul><li>In spring, Google’s <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8HbXG-ZkwAj82Nv49uUrBwOHz4zUj3mkyjIfEd5lU7h3JHZR0pEG5OpkUCPPqwWvqMbjWl\" rel=\"noopener\">PaLM</a> showed state-of-the-art results in few-shot learning on hundreds of tasks that involve language understanding and generation.

The system underwent supervised training on a wide variety of datasets simultaneously, from text and images to actions generated by reinforcement learning agents.</li><li>As the year drew to a close, researchers at Google brought a similar range of abilities to robotics. <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/12/rt-1-robotics-transformer-for-real.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8HbXG-ZkwAj82Nv49uUrBwOHz4zUj3mkyjIfEd5lU7h3JHZR0pEG5OpkUCPPqwWvqMbjWl\" rel=\"noopener\">RT-1</a> is a transformer that enables robots to perform over 700 tasks. The system, which tokenizes actions as well as images, learned from a dataset of 130,000 episodes collected from a fleet of robots over nearly a year and a half. It achieved outstanding zero-shot performance in new tasks, environments, and objects compared to prior techniques.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news: </strong>The latest draft of the European Union’s proposed AI Act, which could become law in 2023, would require users of general-purpose AI systems to register with the authorities, assess their systems for potential misuse, and conduct regular audits. The draft defines general-purpose systems as those that “perform generally applicable functions such as image/speech recognition, audio/video generation, pattern-detection, question-answering, translation, etc.,” and are able to “have multiple intended and unintended purposes.” Some observers have criticized the definition as too broad. The emerging breed of truly general-purpose models may prompt regulators to sharpen their definition.</p><p><strong>Where things stand: </strong>We’re still in the early phases of building algorithms that generalize to hundreds of different tasks, but the year showed that deep learning has the potential to get us there.</p>","comment_id":"63a321765f1ee3003d5085eb","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/ezgif.com-gif-maker-1.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-12-21T07:08:38.000-08:00","updated_at":"2023-02-13T08:32:58.000-08:00","published_at":"2022-12-21T12:35:44.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"The Batch -
