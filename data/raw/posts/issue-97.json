But the principles of how to build AI products and businesses are still developing. I’ve found that there are significant differences, and I’ll explore some of them in this and future letters. <br><br>That AI enables new categories of products and businesses is a familiar theme. However, using this new technology — whether in a startup going from 0 to 1 or a large company incubating a new product — brings special challenges:<br><br><strong>Unclear technical feasibility.</strong> It’s relatively well understood what a traditional mobile app or web app can do. If you can draw a reasonable </em><a href=\"https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/wireframe-example?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">wireframe</a><em>, you can probably build it. But until you’ve examined the data and run some experiments, it’s hard to know how accurate an AI system can be in a given application. For example, many technologists overestimated how easy it would be to build an acceptably safe self-driving car. Generally, AI startups bring higher technical risk than traditional software startups because it’s harder to validate in advance if a given technology proposal is feasible.</em></p><p><em><strong>Complex product specification.</strong> The specification for a traditional web app might come in the form of a wireframe, but you can’t draw a wireframe to indicate how safe a self-driving car must be. It’s extremely complex to specify operating conditions (sometimes also called the operational design domain) and acceptable error rates under various conditions. Similarly, it can be hard to write a spec for a medical diagnosis tool, depending on how acceptable different types of errors are (since not all errors are equally severe). Further, product specs often evolve as the team discovers what is and isn’t technically feasible.</em></p><p><em><strong>Need for data.</strong> To develop a traditional software product, you might (a) interview users to make sure they want what you aim to build, (b) show them a wireframe to make sure your design meets their needs, and (c) dive into writing the code. If you’re building an AI product, you need to write code, but you also need access to data to train and test the system. This may not be a big challenge. For a consumer product, you may be able to start with a small amount of data from an initial cohort of users. But for a product aimed at business customers — say, AI to optimize shipping or help a hospital manage its medical records — how can you get access to shipping data or medical records? To work around this chicken-and-egg problem, some AI startups start by doing consulting or NRE (non-recurring engineering) work. Those activities are hard to scale, but they afford access to data that can shape a scalable product.</em></p><p><em><strong>Additional maintenance cost.</strong> For traditional software, the boundary conditions — the range of valid inputs </em>d<em> — are usually easy to specify. Indeed, traditional software often checks the input to make sure, for example, it’s getting an email address in a field dedicated to that input. But for AI systems, the boundary conditions are less clear. If you have trained a system to process medical records, and the input distribution gradually changes (data drift/concept drift), how can you tell when it has shifted so much that the system requires maintenance?<br><br>Because of these differences between traditional software and AI, the best practices for building AI businesses are different. I’ll dive deeper into these differences in future letters. Meanwhile, please ask your business friends to subscribe to The Batch if they want to understand how to build an AI business!</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!<br><br>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/ezgif.com-gif-maker%20-%202021-06-15T133323.218.gif?width=1200&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=ezgif.com-gif-maker%20-%202021-06-15T133323.218.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Fire-spotting cameras alerting a fire engine\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></figure><h1 id=\"where-there%E2%80%99s-smoke-there%E2%80%99s-ai\">Where There’s Smoke, There’s AI</h1><p>An automated early warning system is alerting firefighters to emerging blazes.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> South Korean company <a href=\"http://alcherainc.com/en?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alchera</a> trained a computer vision system to monitor more than 800 fire-spotting cameras in Sonoma County, California, the local news channel <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/wildfire-ai-artificial-intelligence-sonoma-county/10763475/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ABC7</a> reported.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> Alchera’s <a href=\"https://aiir.ai/industries/fire-detection/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Artificial Intelligence Image Recognition</a> (AIIR) spots smoke plumes caught on camera by a portion of California’s <a href=\"http://www.alertwildfire.org/about.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alert Wildfire</a> network. A convolutional neural network flags video frames in which it recognizes smoke plumes, and an LSTM analyzes the time series to confirm the classification. If smoke is confirmed, an alarm alerts an operator at a central monitoring station.</p><ul><li>The system came online last month. In its first week, it logged over 60 alerts with a false-positive rate of 0.08 percent. It detected one blaze 10 minutes before the first human spotter dialed 9-1-1.</li><li>If the system proves successful, officials aim to expand its purview to other Alert Wildfire cameras installed throughout the state by government agencies, power companies, and others.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Last year, California firefighters used AI to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/national-guards-fire-mapping-drones-get-ai-upgrade/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">convert aerial imagery</a> into maps to monitor fires that might endanger Yosemite National Park.

New work performs the task efficiently enough to run on a beefy personal computer.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Wilson Yan, Yunzhi Zhang, and colleagues at UC Berkeley developed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10157?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VideoGPT</a>, a system that combines image generation with image compression to produce novel videos.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> It takes less computation to learn from compressed image representations than full-fledged image representations.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> VideoGPT comprises a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VQ-VAE</a> (a 3D convolutional neural network that consists of an encoder, an embedding, and a decoder) and an image generator based on <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/image-gpt/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iGPT</a>. The authors trained the models sequentially on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05268?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BAIR Robot Pushing</a> (clips of a robot arm manipulating various objects) and other datasets.</p><ul><li>VQ-VAE’s encoder learned to compress representations of the input video (16x64x64) into smaller representations (8x32x32) where each value is a vector. In the process, it learned an embedding whose vectors encoded information across multiple frames.</li><li>VQ-VAE replaced each vector in the smaller representations with the closest value in the learned embedding, and the decoder learned to reproduce the original frames from these modified representations.</li><li>After training VQ-VAE, the authors used the encoder to compress a video from the training set. They trained iGPT, given a flattened 1D sequence of representations, to generate the next representation by choosing vectors from the learned embedding.</li><li>To generate video, VideoGPT passed a random representation to iGPT, concatenated its output to the input, passed the result back to iGPT, and so on for a fixed number of iterations. VQ-VAE’s decoder converted the concatenated representations into a video.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors evaluated VideoGPT’s performance using Fréchet Video Distance (FVD), a measure of the distance between representations of generated output and training examples (lower is better). The system achieved 103.3 FVD after training on eight GPUs. The state-of-the-art <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02634?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Video Transformer</a> achieved 94 FVD after training on 128 TPUs (roughly equivalent to several hundred GPUs).</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Using VQ-VAE to compress and decompress video is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10704?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">not new</a>, but this work shows how it can be used to cut the computation budget for computer vision tasks.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Setting aside video generation, better video compression is potentially transformative given that most internet traffic is video. The compressed representations in this work, which are tuned to a specific, sometimes narrow training set, may be well suited to imagery from security or baby cams.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Experts%20Panel-6.30_The%20Batch%20Image-1.png?width=1200&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=Experts%20Panel-6.30_The%20Batch%20Image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Experts Panel-6.30_The Batch Image-1\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\"></figure><p>You’re invited!
