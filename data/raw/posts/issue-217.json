Someone who is multilingual — who perhaps speaks English as a first language and Python as a second language — can accomplish much more than someone who knows only how to prompt a large language model (LLM). </em><br><br><em>It’s increasingly possible to tell a computer what you want in English (or whatever human language you’re most fluent in) and it will understand well enough to give you what you asked for. Even before LLMs, Siri and Alexa could respond to basic commands, and the space of English instructions that computers can follow is rapidly expanding. But coding is still immensely valuable. If anything, with the advent of LLMs, the value of coding is rising. Let me explain why. </em><br><br><em>Today, almost everyone has data: big companies, small companies, and even high school students running biology experiments. Thus, the ability to get a custom AI system to work on your own data is valuable. And while prompting an LLM can produce answers for a huge range of questions and generate everything from essays to poems, the set of things you can do with coding plus prompting is significantly larger, for now and the near future. </em><br><br><em>Let’s say I want a summary of every letter I’ve ever written in The Batch. I can copy-paste one letter at a time into an LLM like ChatGPT and ask for a summary of each, but it would be much more efficient for me to write a simple piece of code that iterates over all letters in a database and prompts an LLM to create summaries.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/10/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--15-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Illustration of two people greeting each other in two languages: English and Python\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--15-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--15-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/10/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--15-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>In the future, I hope recruiters will be able to write a few lines of code to summarize candidate reviews, run speech recognition on conversations with references, or execute whatever custom steps are needed in the recruiting workflow. I hope teachers will be able to prompt an LLM to generate learning tasks suited to their lesson plan, and so on. For many roles, coding + prompting will be more powerful than prompting via a web interface alone.</em></p><p><em>Furthermore, English is ambiguous. This contributes to why an LLM’s output in response to a prompt isn’t fully predictable. In contrast, most programming languages are unambiguous, so when you run a piece of code, you reliably (within reason) get back the same result each time. For important applications where reliability is important — say, deciding when to purchase an expensive plane ticket based on real-time prices, or sending a party invitation to everyone in your company — it’s safer to use code to carry out the final step committing to the action, even if an LLM were involved in researching destinations or drafting the invitation.</em></p><p><em>I believe we’re entering an era when everyone can benefit by learning to code. LLMs have made it more valuable than ever. Writing code that calls an LLM has made it easier to build intelligent applications than it was before LLM APIs became widely available. Specifically, everyone can benefit by learning to code AI applications, as I <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/schools-should-teach-ai-to-every-child-according-to-andrew-ng-and-andrea-pasinetti/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-86Kr1L9-Y5aC3cspEg0pBZdyolZ3mOmMLzGQ23fSUn___elEeqkhCko1BF1Nf3crk6HGhL\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> with Andrea Pasinetti, CEO of Kira Learning, an AI Fund portfolio company.</em></p><p><em>If you don’t yet code, consider taking a Python course to get started.

Conventional wisdom suggests training on larger datasets, but research challenges this assumption.</p><p><strong>What’s new: </strong>Abeba Birhane at Trinity College Dublin, a colleague at Michigan State University, and two independent researchers <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13141?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-86Kr1L9-Y5aC3cspEg0pBZdyolZ3mOmMLzGQ23fSUn___elEeqkhCko1BF1Nf3crk6HGhL\" rel=\"noopener\">analyzed</a> publicly available text-image datasets for their proportion of hateful content (that is, content that belittles based on race or gender) and audited models trained on them for racial bias. They found that larger training sets can push models toward greater bias.</p><p><strong>Key insight: </strong>The largest available datasets of text and images are collected indiscriminately, with little curation after the fact. Removing objectionable material from such immense corpora is challenging. Researchers often rely on automatic filters like the <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/clip?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-86Kr1L9-Y5aC3cspEg0pBZdyolZ3mOmMLzGQ23fSUn___elEeqkhCko1BF1Nf3crk6HGhL\" rel=\"noopener\">CLIP</a> similarity between images and text to filter out bad data. To create larger datasets, they often relax those filters. Consequently, larger datasets can harbor a higher proportion of objectionable material than smaller datasets, and training on them could yield models whose performance is more biased.</p><p><strong>How it works: </strong>The authors compared hateful language in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02114?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-86Kr1L9-Y5aC3cspEg0pBZdyolZ3mOmMLzGQ23fSUn___elEeqkhCko1BF1Nf3crk6HGhL\" rel=\"noopener\">LAION 400M</a>, which comprises 400 million image-text pairs scraped from the web, to similar data in <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2B-en?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-86Kr1L9-Y5aC3cspEg0pBZdyolZ3mOmMLzGQ23fSUn___elEeqkhCko1BF1Nf3crk6HGhL\" rel=\"noopener\">LAION 2B-en</a>, which includes 2 billion image-text pairs also scraped from the web. They also analyzed racial biases present in models trained on both datasets.</p><ul><li>To identify hateful language, the authors ran <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09462?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-86Kr1L9-Y5aC3cspEg0pBZdyolZ3mOmMLzGQ23fSUn___elEeqkhCko1BF1Nf3crk6HGhL\" rel=\"noopener\">pysentimiento</a>, a Python library for sentiment analysis, on the text of each text-image example to find the probability that it belonged to one of three categories: hateful, targeted (that is, hateful and aimed at a specific person or group), or aggressive. They assessed each dataset according to its Hate Content Rate (HCR), the proportion of examples whose probability of being hateful, targeted, or aggressive surpassed a threshold value.</li><li>To compare racial bias, they trained identical <a href=\"https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-86Kr1L9-Y5aC3cspEg0pBZdyolZ3mOmMLzGQ23fSUn___elEeqkhCko1BF1Nf3crk6HGhL\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenCLIP</a> architectures on each dataset. Then they used the models to classify <a href=\"https://www.chicagofaces.org/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-86Kr1L9-Y5aC3cspEg0pBZdyolZ3mOmMLzGQ23fSUn___elEeqkhCko1BF1Nf3crk6HGhL\" rel=\"noopener\">headshots</a> of nearly 600 individuals along with their self-identified race and gender as eight classes that included “human being,” “gorilla,” “suspicious person,” and “criminal.” They evaluated the models’ bias based on the percentage of faces associated with a given race and gender they classified with a label other than “human being.”</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>The authors found a statistically-significantly lower proportion of hateful content in the smaller dataset. LAION-400M’s HCR in the “hateful” category was up to 0.1 percent lower relative to LAION-2B. The probability that a model would classify a face as “human being” fell from 18.6 percent for OpenCLIP-400M to 9.4 percent for OpenCLIP-2B, and the probabilities of classification as “criminal” and “suspicious person” rose. OpenCLIP-400M classified a portrait of a black man as a criminal 14 percent of the time, while OpenCLIP-2B did so 77.4 percent of the time. Despite the increase in biased classifications, OpenCLIP-2B achieved 1.5 percent higher accuracy on ImageNet.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Increasing numbers of open source models and consumer-facing products are trained on large, web-scraped datasets. For example, Stable Diffusion was <a href=\"https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/blob/main/Stable_Diffusion_v1_Model_Card.md?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-86Kr1L9-Y5aC3cspEg0pBZdyolZ3mOmMLzGQ23fSUn___elEeqkhCko1BF1Nf3crk6HGhL\" rel=\"noopener\">trained</a> largely on the 5B version of LAION. This work throws up a red flag for machine learning practitioners to consider the bias such training can impart, the harm such models might do, and the methods used to collect and curate large datasets.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> This work goes to show that data-centric AI is applicable even to the largest datasets. It's easier to focus on higher-quality data sources when collecting 400 million examples than 2 billion examples.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong>Google introduced a way for publishers to opt-out from training AI</strong><br>The Google-Extended control setting allows website administrators to manage access to their data and other content.
