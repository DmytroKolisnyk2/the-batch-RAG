For example, if we ask an agent to do online research on a given topic, we might use an LLM to break down the objective into smaller subtasks, such as researching specific subtopics, synthesizing findings, and compiling a report.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people had a “ChatGPT moment” shortly after ChatGPT was released, when they played with it and were surprised that it significantly exceeded their expectation of what AI can do. If you have not yet had a similar “AI Agentic moment,” I hope you will soon. I had one several months ago, when I presented a live demo of a research agent I had implemented that had access to various online search tools.&nbsp;</p><p>I had tested this agent multiple times privately, during which it consistently used a web search tool to gather information and wrote up a summary. During the live demo, though, the web search API unexpectedly returned with a rate limiting error. I thought my demo was about to fail publicly, and I dreaded what was to come next. To my surprise, the agent pivoted deftly to a Wikipedia search tool — which I had forgotten I’d given it — and completed the task using Wikipedia instead of web search.&nbsp;</p><p>This was an AI Agentic moment of surprise for me. I think many people who haven’t experienced such a moment yet will do so in the coming months. It’s a beautiful thing when you see an agent autonomously decide to do things in ways that you had not anticipated, and succeed as a result!</p><p>Many tasks can’t be done in a single step or with a single tool invocation, but an agent can decide what steps to take. For example, to simplify an example from the HuggingGPT paper (cited below), if you want an agent to consider a picture of a boy and draw a picture of a girl in the same pose, the task might be decomposed into two distinct steps: (i) detect the pose in the picture of the boy and (ii) render a picture of a girl in the detected pose. An LLM might be fine-tuned or prompted (with few-shot prompting) to specify a plan by outputting a string like&nbsp;<em>\"{tool: pose-detection, input: image.jpg, output: temp1 } {tool: pose-to-image, input: temp1, output: final.jpg}\"</em>.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/04/unnamed---2024-04-10T140722.194.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/unnamed---2024-04-10T140722.194.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/unnamed---2024-04-10T140722.194.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/04/unnamed---2024-04-10T140722.194.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>This structured output, which specifies two steps to take, then triggers software to invoke a pose detection tool followed by a pose-to-image tool to complete the task. (This example is for illustrative purposes only; HuggingGPT uses a different format.)&nbsp;</p><p>Admittedly, many agentic workflows do not need planning. For example, you might have an agent reflect on, and improve, its output a fixed number of times. In this case, the sequence of steps the agent takes is fixed and deterministic. But for complex tasks in which you aren’t able to specify a decomposition of the task into a set of steps ahead of time, Planning allows the agent to decide dynamically what steps to take.&nbsp;</p><p>On one hand, Planning is a very powerful capability; on the other, it leads to less predictable results. In my experience, while I can get the agentic design patterns of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/agentic-design-patterns-part-2-reflection?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Kh954rkXmE4vgpKvro3Klpjhn7IuT-Y_eXIYtgVIq9PTzwa5zFWX7FZZqv1tuDEEsTDuY\" rel=\"noopener\">Reflection</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/agentic-design-patterns-part-3-tool-use/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Kh954rkXmE4vgpKvro3Klpjhn7IuT-Y_eXIYtgVIq9PTzwa5zFWX7FZZqv1tuDEEsTDuY\" rel=\"noopener\">Tool use</a>&nbsp;to work reliably and improve my applications’ performance, Planning is a less mature technology, and I find it hard to predict in advance what it will do.

Making sure your RAG system has access to the data it needs to answer questions is an important, but often laborious, step for good performance. Our new short course “Preprocessing Unstructured Data for LLM Applications,” taught by Matt Robinson of Unstructured, teaches you how to build systems that can easily ingest data from a wide range of formats (like text, images, and tables) and from many different sources (like PDF, PowerPoint, and HTML). You’ll learn practical ways to extract and normalize content from diverse formats, enrich your content with metadata to enable more powerful retrieval and reasoning, and use document layout analysis and vision transformers to process embedded images and tables. Putting these components together, you’ll build a RAG bot that draws from multiple document types, demonstrating how high-quality data ingestion and preprocessing affect the quality of RAG output. <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/preprocessing-unstructured-data-for-llm-applications?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Kh954rkXmE4vgpKvro3Klpjhn7IuT-Y_eXIYtgVIq9PTzwa5zFWX7FZZqv1tuDEEsTDuY\" rel=\"noopener\">Sign up here</a>!</p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/04/DEVIN-PLUS-v6_1200px.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/DEVIN-PLUS-v6_1200px.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/DEVIN-PLUS-v6_1200px.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/04/DEVIN-PLUS-v6_1200px.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"coding-agents-proliferate\">Coding Agents Proliferate</h1><p>New coding tools act like agents to automate software programming tasks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;A wave of open source software-development tools based on large language models take advantage of the ability of large language models to plan, critique their own work, and extend themselves by calling functions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;These projects follow hot on the heels of Cognition’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Kh954rkXmE4vgpKvro3Klpjhn7IuT-Y_eXIYtgVIq9PTzwa5zFWX7FZZqv1tuDEEsTDuY\" rel=\"noopener\">Devin</a>, a commercial system billed as a semi-autonomous software developer that’s available to selected customers upon request.

Unlike RNNs and their extensions including LSTMs — but like transformers — they can also perform an equivalent computation in parallel during training. In addition, they are more computationally efficient than transformers. An S4’s computation and memory requirements rise linearly with input size, while a vanilla transformer’s rise quadratically — a heavy burden with long input sequences.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;S4s are more efficient than transformers but, while a transformer’s input length is limited only by processing and memory, an S4’s input length is limited by how well its hidden state can represent previously input tokens as new tokens arrive.

One viable gate: Typically S4s apply the same mathematical function to all input tokens, whose parameters consist of four learned matrices. Changing the matrices for each input enables the model to learn which tokens or parts of tokens are least important and can be ignored (set to zero). This condenses the input, enabling the modified S4 to process very long input sequences.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;Mamba is made up of blocks, each of which includes a modified S4 (which the authors call a selective SSM).
