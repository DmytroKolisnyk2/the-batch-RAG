It was fun to catch up with old friends, make new ones, and also get a wide scan of current AI research. Work by the big tech companies tends to get all the media coverage, and NeurIPS was a convenient place to survey the large volume of equally high-quality work by universities and small companies that just don’t have a comparable marketing budget!&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>AI research has become so broad that I struggle to summarize everything I saw in a few sentences. There were numerous papers on generative AI, including large language models, large multimodal models, diffusion models, enabling LLMs to use tools (function calls), and building 3D avatars. There was also plenty of work on data-centric AI, differential privacy, kernels, federated learning, reinforcement learning, and many other areas.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>One topic I’m following closely is autonomous agents: Software, usually based on LLMs, that can take a high-level direction (say, to carry out competitive research for a company), autonomously decide on &nbsp;a complex sequence of actions, and execute it to deliver the outcome. Such agents have been very hard to control and debug, and so, despite amazing-looking demos, there have been few practical deployments. But now I see them on the cusp of working well enough to make it into many more applications, and increasingly I play with them in my spare time. I look forward to getting through my reading list of autonomous agent research papers over the coming holiday!&nbsp;</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/12/unnamed--35--1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/unnamed--35--1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/unnamed--35--1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/12/unnamed--35--1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>At NeurIPS, many people I spoke with expressed anxiety about the pace of AI development and how to keep up as well as publish, if what you're working on could be scooped (that is, independently published ahead of you) at any moment.

Many conversations I had at NeurIPS were about where AI might go in months or even years.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>I like to work quickly, but I find problem solving most satisfying when I’ve developed an idea that I believe in — especially if it’s something that few others see or believe in — and then spend a long time executing it to prove out the vision (hopefully). I find technical work more fulfilling when I have time to think deeply, form my own conclusion, and perhaps even hold an unpopular opinion for a long time as I work to prove it. There’s a lot of value in doing fast, short-term work; and given the large size of our community, it’s important to have many of us doing long-term projects, too.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>So, this holiday season, when the pace of big announcements might slow down for a couple of weeks, I hope you’ll take a break. Spend time with friends and loved ones, let thoughts simmer in the back of your mind, and remind yourself of holiday values like charity and renewal. If you’re looking for ideas, maybe even some that will keep you productively busy for months or years, injecting more inputs — taking courses, reading blogs or papers — is a good way to do that.</em></p><p><em>It has been a great year for AI, with lots of progress and excitement.

Japan is a notable exception: The country’s copyright law apparently allows training machine learning models on copyrighted works.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Where things stand:</strong>&nbsp;Most copyright laws were written long ago.

The bill limits certain AI applications including biometric identification or determinations of eligibility for employment public services. It also mandates that developers of general-purpose models disclose information to regulators. The law imposes a lighter burden on smaller companies and provides some exceptions for open source models. Like China, it exempts member states’s military and police forces.</li></ul><p><strong>Striking a balance:</strong>&nbsp;AI has innumerable beneficial applications that we are only just beginning to explore. Excessive worry over hypothetical catastrophic risks threatens to block AI applications that could bring great benefit to large numbers of people. Some moves to limit AI would impinge on open source development, a major engine of innovation, while having the anti-competitive effect of enabling established companies to continue to develop the technology in their own narrow interest. It’s critical to weigh the harm that regulators might do by limiting this technology in the short term against highly unlikely catastrophic scenarios.</p><p><strong>Where things stand:</strong>&nbsp;AI development is moving too quickly for regulators to keep up. It will require great foresight — and a willingness to do the hard work of identifying real, application-level risks rather than imposing blanket regulations on basic technology — to limit AI’s potential harms without hampering the good that it can do. The EU’s AI Act is a case in point: The bill, initially drafted in 2021, has needed numerous revisions to address developments since then. Should it gain final approval, it will not take effect within two years. By then, AI likely will raise further issues that lawmakers can’t see clearly today.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/12/unnamed--41-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/unnamed--41-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/unnamed--41-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/12/unnamed--41-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"deep-learning-rocks\">Deep Learning Rocks</h1><p>Fans of AI-driven music pressed play, while a major recording company reached for the stop button.</p><p><strong>What happened:</strong>&nbsp;AI grabbed listeners by the ears when it helped produce a new single by The Beatles, mimicked the voices of beloved stars, and generated music from text prompts.</p><p><strong>Driving the story:</strong>&nbsp;AI hasn’t quite had its first hit record, but developments in generated music put both fans and the record industry on notice that it may not be far away.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Giles Martin, son of the producer of The Beatles’ classic 1960s records, used a proprietary audio&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/new-life-for-old-songs/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9-LKHyEB55rirjHlERM7jVa7sKhZ4ZecA6DNcVzmxaa-Gs-QBB6iBUHJ_bQZprPwy5Srrv\" rel=\"noopener\">demixing</a>&nbsp;algorithm to pick apart a crude recording of an unreleased song by deceased band member John Lennon.
