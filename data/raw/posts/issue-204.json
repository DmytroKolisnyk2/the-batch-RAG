I wrote in an earlier <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-prompting-is-changing-machine-learning-development/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">letter</a> that this rapid development is causing developers to do away with test sets.</em></p><p><em>The speed of prompt-based development is also changing the process of <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/five-steps-to-scoping-ai-projects/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">scoping projects</a>. In lieu of careful planning, it’s increasingly viable to throw a lot of projects at the wall to see what sticks, because each throw is inexpensive.</em></p><p><em>Specifically, if building a system took 6 months, it would make sense for product managers and business teams to plan the process carefully and proceed only if the investment seemed worthwhile. But if building something takes only 1 day, then it makes sense to just build it and see if it succeeds, and discard it if it doesn’t. The low cost of trying an idea also means teams can try out a lot more ideas in parallel.</em></p><p><em>Say you’re in charge of building a natural language processing system to process inbound customer-service emails, and a teammate wants to track customer sentiment over time. Before the era of large pre-trained text transformers, this project might involve labeling thousands of examples, training and iterating on a model for weeks, and then setting up a custom inference server to make predictions. Given the effort involved, before you started building, you might also want to increase confidence in the investment by having a product manager spend a few days designing the sentiment display dashboard and verifying whether users found it valuable.</em></p><p><em>But if a proof of concept for this project can be built in a day by prompting a large language model, then, rather than spending days/weeks planning the project, it makes more sense to just build it. Then you can quickly test technical feasibility (by seeing if your system generates accurate labels) and business feasibility (by seeing if the output is valuable to users). If it turns out to be either technically too challenging or unhelpful to users, the feedback can help you improve the concept or discard it.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/unnamed--23--1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/unnamed--23--1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/unnamed--23--1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/unnamed--23--1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>I find this workflow exciting because, in addition to increasing the speed of iteration for individual projects, it significantly increases the volume of ideas we can try. In addition to plotting the sentiment of customer emails, why not experiment with automatically routing emails to the right department, providing a brief summary of each email to managers, clustering emails to help spot trends, and many more creative ideas? Instead of planning and executing one machine learning feature, it’s increasingly possible to build many, quickly check if they look good, ship them to users if so, and get rapid feedback to drive the next step of decision making.</em></p><p><em>One important caveat: As I mentioned in the letter about eliminating test sets, we shouldn’t let the speed of iteration lead us to forgo responsible AI. It’s fantastic that we can ship quick-and-dirty applications. But if there is risk of nontrivial harm such as bias, unfairness, privacy violation, or malevolent uses that outweigh beneficial uses, we have a responsibility to evaluate our systems’ performance carefully and ensure that they’re safe before we deploy them widely.</em></p><p><em>What ideas do you have for prompt-based applications?

But the people who do the labeling face challenges that impinge on the quality of both their work and their lives.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> <em>The Verge</em> interviewed more than two dozen data annotators, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8_61uz3NEGB7cgnbfxnJLBikpmuc-2IC68FtByin77C-1cr6uYknPMSMeKYigNKPx7tBgR\" rel=\"noopener\">revealing</a> a difficult, precarious gig economy. Workers often find themselves jaded by low pay, uncertain schedules, escalating complexity, and deep secrecy about what they’re doing and why.<br><br><strong>How it works: </strong>Companies that provide labeling services including Centaur Labs, Surge AI, and Remotasks (a division of data supplier Scale AI) use automated systems to manage gig workers worldwide. Workers undergo qualification exams, training, and performance monitoring to perform tasks like drawing bounding boxes, classifying sentiments expressed by social media posts, evaluating video clips for sexual content, sorting credit-card transactions, rating chatbot responses, and uploading selfies of various facial expressions.</p><ul><li>The pay scale varies widely, depending on the worker’s location and the task assigned, from $1 per hour in Kenya to $25 per hour or more in the U.S. Some tasks that require specialized knowledge, sound judgment, and/or extensive labor can pay up to $300 per task.</li><li>To protect their clients’ trade secrets, employers dole out assignments without identifying the client, application, or function. Workers don’t know the purpose of the labels they’re called upon to produce, and they’re warned against talking about their work.</li><li>The assignments often begin with ambiguous instructions. They may call for, say, labeling actual clothing that might be worn by a human being, so clothes in a photo of a toy doll or a cartoon drawing clearly don’t qualify. But do images of clothing reflected in a mirror? And does a suit of armor count as clothing? How about swimming fins? As developers iterate on their models, rules that govern how the data should be labeled become more elaborate, forcing labelers to keep in mind a growing variety of exceptions and special cases. Workers who make too many mistakes may lose the gig.</li><li>Work schedules are sporadic and unpredictable. Workers don’t know when the next assignment will arise or how long it will last, whether the next gig will be interesting or soul-crushing, or whether it will pay well or poorly. Such uncertainty — and differential between their wages and their employers’ revenue as reported in the press — can leave workers demoralized.</li><li>Many labelers manage the stress by gathering in clandestine groups on WhatsApp to share information and seek advice about how to find good gigs and avoid undesirable ones. There, they learn tricks like using existing AI models to do the work, connecting through proxy servers to disguise their locations and maintaining multiple accounts as a hedge against suspension for getting caught breaking rules.</li></ul><p><strong>What they’re saying: </strong>“AI doesn’t replace work. But it does change how work is organized.” —Erik Duhaime, CEO, Centaur Labs</p><p><strong>Behind the news: </strong>Stanford computer scientist Fei-Fei Li was an early pioneer in crowdsourcing data annotations. In 2007, she led a team at Princeton to scale the number of images used to train an image recognizer from tens of thousands to millions. To get the work done, the team hired thousands of workers via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. The result was ImageNet, a key computer vision dataset.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Developing high-performance AI systems depends on accurately annotated data. Yet the harsh economics of annotating at scale encourages service providers to automate the work and workers to either cut corners or drop out. Notwithstanding recent improvements — for instance, Google <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/google-contractors-get-a-raise/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">raised</a> its base wage for contractors who evaluate search results and ads to $15 per hour — everyone would benefit from treating data annotation less like gig work and more like a profession.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>The value of skilled annotators becomes even more apparent as AI practitioners adopt data-centric development practices that make it possible to build effective systems with relatively few examples. With far fewer examples, selecting and annotating them properly is absolutely critical.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/unnamed--67-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/unnamed--67-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"making-government-multilingual\">Making Government Multilingual</h1><p>An app is bridging the language gap between the Indian government and its citizens, who speak a wide variety of languages.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/en-in/features/with-help-from-next-generation-ai-indian-villagers-gain-easier-access-to-government-services/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8_61uz3NEGB7cgnbfxnJLBikpmuc-2IC68FtByin77C-1cr6uYknPMSMeKYigNKPx7tBgR\" rel=\"noopener\">Jugalbandi</a> helps Indians learn about government services, which typically are described online in English and Hindi, in their native tongues.

A classifier can learn to recognize that the error occurred, randomly at first, and reward the RL model when it triggers the error. In this scheme, training requires a small number of student submissions that have been labeled with a particular error that is known to occur. The two models learn in an alternating fashion: The RL model plays for a while and does or doesn’t bring about the error; the classifier classifies the RL model’s actions (that is, it applies the model’s label to actions that trigger the error and, if so, dispenses a reward), then the RL model plays more, and so on.

The system comprised two components for each type of error: (i) a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8_61uz3NEGB7cgnbfxnJLBikpmuc-2IC68FtByin77C-1cr6uYknPMSMeKYigNKPx7tBgR\" rel=\"noopener\">player</a> that played the game (a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06581.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8_61uz3NEGB7cgnbfxnJLBikpmuc-2IC68FtByin77C-1cr6uYknPMSMeKYigNKPx7tBgR\" rel=\"noopener\">double dueling deep Q-network</a>) and (ii) a classifier (an LSTM and vanilla neural network) that decided whether the error occurred.</p><ul><li>The player played the game for 100 steps, each comprising a video frame and associated paddle motion, or until the score exceeded 30. The model moved the paddle based on the gameplay’s “trajectory”: (i) current x and y coordinates of the paddle and ball, (ii) x and y velocities of the ball, and (iii) previous paddle movements, coordinates, ball velocities, and rewards.</li><li>The player received a reward for bringing about an error, and it was trained to maximize its reward. To compute rewards, the system calculated the difference between the classification (error or no error) of the trajectory at the current and previous steps. In this way, the player received a reward only at the step in which the error occurred.</li><li>The feedback classifier learned in a supervised manner.</li><li>The authors repeated this process many times for each program to cover a wide variety of gameplay situations.</li><li>At inference, DreamGrader ran each player-and-classifier pair on a program and output a list of errors it found.</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>The authors evaluated DreamGrader on a test set of Code.org student submissions. For comparison, they modified the previous <a href=\"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/0b9b6d6d154e98ce34b3f2e4ef76eae9-Abstract.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8_61uz3NEGB7cgnbfxnJLBikpmuc-2IC68FtByin77C-1cr6uYknPMSMeKYigNKPx7tBgR\" rel=\"noopener\">Play to Grade</a>, which had been designed to identify error-free submissions, to predict the presence of a specific error. DreamGrader achieved 94.3 percent accuracy — 1.5 percent short of human-level performance — while Play to Grade achieved 75.5 percent accuracy. It evaluated student submissions in around 1 second each, 180 times faster than human-level performance.</p><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> DreamGrader finds only known errors. It can’t catch bugs that instructors haven’t already seen.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Each student submission can be considered a different, related task. The approach known as meta-RL aims to train an agent that can learn new tasks based on experience with related tasks. Connecting these two ideas, the authors trained their model following the learning techniques expressed in the meta-RL algorithm <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02790?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8_61uz3NEGB7cgnbfxnJLBikpmuc-2IC68FtByin77C-1cr6uYknPMSMeKYigNKPx7tBgR\" rel=\"noopener\">DREAM</a>. Sometimes it’s not about reinventing the wheel, but reframing the problem as one we already know how to solve.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>Teaching people how to code empowers them to lead more fulfilling lives in the digital age, just as teaching them to read has opened doors to wisdom and skill since the invention of the printing press. Accomplishing this on a global scale requires automated systems for education (like Coursera!). It’s great to see AI research that could make these systems more effective.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong>OpenAI sued over alleged violation of privacy</strong><br>Several unnamed plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging that its use of information found on the internet to train its models constitutes offenses such as larceny, copyright infringement, and invasion of privacy.
