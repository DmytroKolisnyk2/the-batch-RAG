(ii) Open weight models are commoditizing the foundation-model layer, which creates opportunities for application builders. (iii) Scaling up isn’t the only path to AI progress. Despite the massive focus on and hype around processing power, algorithmic innovations are rapidly pushing down training costs.</p><p>About a week ago, DeepSeek, a company based in China, released&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/deepseek-r1-an-affordable-rival-to-openais-o1/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9blkmNCmkSgQZlF3w69mEVR39Kcgh5igqFqSYQXxJbJImIrQOL0IJdK2usUU4q7nNePZXv\" rel=\"noopener\">DeepSeek-R1</a>, a remarkable model whose performance on benchmarks is comparable to OpenAI’s o1. Further, it was released as an open weight model with a permissive MIT license. At Davos last week, I got a lot of questions about it from non-technical business leaders. And on Monday, the stock market saw a “DeepSeek selloff”: The share prices of Nvidia and a number of other U.S. tech companies plunged. (As of the time of writing, they have recovered somewhat.)</p><p>Here’s what I think DeepSeek has caused many people to realize:</p><p><strong>China is catching up to the U.S. in generative AI.&nbsp;</strong>When ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, the U.S. was significantly ahead of China in generative AI. Impressions change slowly, and so even recently I heard friends in both the U.S. and China say they thought China was behind. But in reality, this gap has rapidly eroded over the past two years. With models from China such as Qwen (which my teams have used for months), Kimi, InternVL, and DeepSeek, China had clearly been closing the gap, and in areas such as video generation there were already moments where China seemed to be in the lead.</p><p>I’m thrilled that DeepSeek-R1 was released as an open weight model, with a technical report that shares many details. In contrast, a number of U.S. companies have pushed for regulation to stifle open source by hyping up hypothetical AI dangers such as human extinction. It is now clear that open source/open weight models are a key part of the AI supply chain: Many companies will use them. If the U.S. continues to stymie open source, China will come to dominate this part of the supply chain and many businesses will end up using models that reflect China’s values much more than America’s.</p><p><strong>Open weight models are commoditizing the foundation-model layer.</strong>&nbsp;As I wrote previously, LLM token prices have been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/falling-llm-token-prices-and-what-they-mean-for-ai-companies/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9blkmNCmkSgQZlF3w69mEVR39Kcgh5igqFqSYQXxJbJImIrQOL0IJdK2usUU4q7nNePZXv\" rel=\"noopener\">falling</a>&nbsp;rapidly, and open weights have contributed to this trend and given developers more choice. OpenAI’s o1 costs $60 per million output tokens; DeepSeek R1 costs $2.19. This nearly 30x difference brought the trend of falling prices to the attention of many people.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/Captura-de-pantalla-2025-01-29-a-la-s--1.31.32-p.-m..png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Blue whale logo biting and breaking a computer chip, with debris flying.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1196\" height=\"696\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/Captura-de-pantalla-2025-01-29-a-la-s--1.31.32-p.-m..png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/Captura-de-pantalla-2025-01-29-a-la-s--1.31.32-p.-m..png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/Captura-de-pantalla-2025-01-29-a-la-s--1.31.32-p.-m..png 1196w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>The business of training foundation models and selling API access is tough. Many companies in this area are still looking for a path to recouping the massive cost of model training. The article “<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VXh_Qm5KbXxcW4Xwy2w54Qvn8VDyhz95rpBjMN4Rsyg63qgyTW7lCdLW6lZ3nZW58Md6V8n62H8W1Xy7Fh7pDgmlW1_d1pS1HpN5KW2-f95T7Rjym-W8S4_zx4WvtXtW2XS44J5Nsr8HN9bYgNW38zBwW5wbm7G606tD0W34g-sL6HQwV7W2-g3434hlydmW28tdH11M6mVxW5Ss5jQ8vDPBkW61_Y6G3nghy2W6gVxxZ4xgJBxW7sP2vV5zfKw5VgZ_6t5XSx-WW3t838B8JlmQpW5Gcpdw5dBRMbN1H1DSzQcC-HN8SwbVGt26JDW8cgWNr5H9SDCW1R4lyR3q6Pv_W7k22V37K_XMQW4t5-FQ6_nvljf7Z3qb-04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">AI’s $600B Question</a>” lays out the challenge well (but, to be clear, I think the foundation model companies are doing great work, and I hope they succeed). In contrast, building applications on top of foundation models presents many great business opportunities. Now that others have spent billions training such models, you can access these models for mere dollars to build customer service chatbots, email summarizers, AI doctors, legal document assistants, and much more.</p><p><strong>Scaling up isn’t the only path to AI progress.</strong>&nbsp;There’s been a lot of hype around scaling up models as a way to drive progress. To be fair, I was an early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VXh_Qm5KbXxcW4Xwy2w54Qvn8VDyhz95rpBjMN4RsygK3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3plN2fbywD3qy7zVWxjrC2BXSstW5mSjrR476trZW2m1GyH23Vm4bW2GxwrR6kkZx_W8VCPP46phNgbW5MwvKB4pVDQqW5T_CsY18p01jW4Gj9WK5GVM2MW8Yzn8-1yfDFlV22wSP48x9vqW45SYRw3k2487N3WlTRsScYD9W1_4y-m4JDzBLW2lhvpX2xglBVW7vR8bP2hqPsYW2vc-2s2jxYTwW8Rbw1_7F7QZjW2m06pS2GJWX1W8xGwws295t4RN5vd1MW1GdPMW6JvkJq1367BrW5Cm6Vq1kGdtwW5j5R8Z4rnG1bW8gV5MF38XkcSW6FFfyw5JzjcxW75VjSN7SCW5wW6WR0698j1SFKf6vBVJg04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">proponent</a>&nbsp;of scaling up models. A number of companies raised billions of dollars by generating buzz around the narrative that, with more capital, they could (i) scale up and (ii) predictably drive improvements. Consequently, there has been a huge focus on scaling up, as opposed to a more nuanced view that gives due attention to the many different ways we can make progress. Driven in part by the U.S. AI chip embargo, the DeepSeek team had to innovate on many optimizations to run on less-capable H800 GPUs rather than H100s, leading ultimately to a model trained (omitting research costs) for under $6M of compute.</p><p>It remains to be seen if this will actually reduce demand for compute. Sometimes making each unit of a good cheaper can result in more dollars in total going to buy that good. I think the demand for intelligence and compute has practically no ceiling over the long term, so I remain bullish that humanity will use more intelligence even as it gets cheaper.</p><p>I saw many different interpretations of DeepSeek’s progress on social media, as if it was a Rorschach test that allowed many people to project their own meaning onto it. I think DeepSeek-R1 has geopolitical implications that are yet to be worked out. And it’s also great for AI application builders. My team has already been brainstorming ideas that are newly possible only because we have easy access to an open advanced reasoning model. This continues to be a great time to build!</p><p>Keep learning,</p><p>Andrew</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-towards-computer-use-with-anthropic/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--5--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Promo banner for &quot;Building Towards Computer Use with Anthropic&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--5--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--5--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--5--1.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--5--1.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Discover Anthropic’s new capabilty - Computer Use - that allows LLM-based agents use a computer interface.

Unlike supervised and unsupervised learning, which compare the model's output to a known ground truth, RL doesn’t explicitly tell a model what it should output. Instead, the model starts out behaving randomly and discovers desired behaviors by earning rewards for its actions. This makes RL especially popular for training machine learning models that play games or control robots.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;To improve the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9blkmNCmkSgQZlF3w69mEVR39Kcgh5igqFqSYQXxJbJImIrQOL0IJdK2usUU4q7nNePZXv\" rel=\"noopener\">chain of thought</a>&nbsp;(CoT) generated by a large language model (LLM), reinforcement learning encourages the model to generate correct solutions to math, coding, science, and other problems that have known solutions. Unlike typical LLM training, in which the model simply generates the next token of its output and receives feedback token by token, this method rewards the model for generating a sequence of reasoning steps that lead to an accurate conclusion, even if doing so requires generating many intermediate tokens between the prompt and the response — to plan an outline, check the conclusion, or reflect on the approach — without explicit training on the reasoning steps to take.</p><ul><li>The DeepSeek team found that fine-tuning via reinforcement learning alone (after pretraining) was sufficient for DeepSeek-R1-Zero to learn problem-solving strategies like double checking its answer. However, the model also showed quirky behaviors such as mixing different languages in its output. The team overcame these issues in DeepSeek-R1 by supervised fine-tuning on a small number of long CoT examples prior to reinforcement learning.</li><li>Similarly, the Kimi k1.5 team found that fine-tuning the model on long CoTs prior to reinforcement learning enabled it to devise its own problem-solving strategies. The resulting long responses proved to be more accurate but also more expensive to generate, so the team added a second round of reinforcement learning that encouraged the model to produce shorter responses.

After fine-tuning on the lowest-toxicity responses generated by Llama 2 7B, Mixtral 8x7B’s expected maximum toxicity fell to 43.2. Conversely, after fine-tuning on random responses generated by Llama 2 7B, its expected maximum toxicity rose to 70.3.</li><li>It also helped Llama 2 7B to cut its toxicity. Before fine-tuning, the model’s expected maximum toxicity was 71.7. After fine-tuning on its own least-toxic responses, expected maximum toxicity dropped to 50.7. Fine-tuning on random responses made its expected maximum toxicity fall less sharply to 68.1.</li><li>Examining the impact of the authors’ method on more typical measures of performance, fine-tuning on the least-toxic responses and fine-tuning on random responses had about the same effect across seven benchmarks. Fine-tuning Llama 2 7B on its own least-toxic responses increased performance on average from 59.97 percent accuracy to 60.22 percent accuracy, while fine-tuning on random responses increased performance on average from 59.97 percent accuracy to 61.05 percent accuracy.</li><li>However, the process degraded performance in some cases. Fine-tuning Mixtral-8x7B on the least-toxic Llama 2 7B responses decreased its average performance across seven benchmarks for question answering and common-sense reasoning from 70.24 percent accuracy to 67.48 percent accuracy. Fine-tuning it on random Llama 2 7B responses cut its average performance from 70.24 percent accuracy to 65.64 percent accuracy.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Training on synthetic data is becoming increasingly common. While it shows great promise, best practices for data generation are still being formulated. The authors’ method helps by automatically steering models toward generating more desirable responses, reducing negative traits and reinforcing positive traits.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Knowledge distillation lately has led to more capable and compact models. This approach adds levers of fine control to that technique.</p>","comment_id":"679aac424baf6800019cd255","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/DeepSeek-Byte7_3D-1.jpg","featured":true,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2025-01-29T14:31:30.000-08:00","updated_at":"2025-02-11T06:50:03.000-08:00","published_at":"2025-01-29T14:48:00.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"The
