For many who hear this advice, “projects” may evoke a significant undertaking that delivers value to users. But I encourage you to set a lower bar and relish small, weekend tinkering projects that let you learn, even if they don’t result in a meaningful deliverable.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, my son and daughter (ages 3 and 5) were building Lego vehicles. They built a beautiful ice-cream truck as well as a . . . umm . . . colorful and asymmetric dinosaur car, shown in the picture below. While most observers would judge the ice-cream truck as the superior creation, my kids built it by following Lego’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/creative-vehicles-11036?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--m4fcSeHyJiOf4e1eGvAF8GwjRy14x6ZFA7G4MfWSSp4-IyUmw-vCQVPjnJ0ispU4C92r2\" rel=\"noopener\">instructions</a>, and it is likely identical to thousands of ice-cream trucks built by others. In contrast, building the dinosaur car required creativity and novel thinking. The exercise helped them hone their ability to pick and assemble Lego building blocks.</p><p>There is, of course, room for both mimicking others’ designs (with permission) and coming up with your own. As a parent, I try to celebrate both. (To be honest, I celebrated the dinosaur car more.) When learning to build Lego, it’s helpful to start by following a template. But eventually, building your own unique projects enriches your skills.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/05/unnamed---2024-05-22T145628.272-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/unnamed---2024-05-22T145628.272-1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/unnamed---2024-05-22T145628.272-1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/05/unnamed---2024-05-22T145628.272-1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>As a developer, too, I try to celebrate unique creations. Yes, it is nice to have beautiful software, and the impact of the output does matter. But good software is often written by people who spend many hours tinkering and building things. By building unique projects, you master key software building blocks. Then, using those blocks, you can go on to build bigger projects.</p><p>I routinely tinker with building AI applications, and a lot of my tinkering doesn’t result in anything useful. My latest example: I built a Streamlit app that would authenticate to Google docs, read the text in a doc, use a large language model to edit my text, and write the result back into the doc. I didn’t find it useful in the end because of friction in the user interface, and I’m sure a commercial provider will soon, if they haven’t already, build a better product than I was able to throw together in a couple of hours on a weekend. But such tinkering helps me hone my intuition and master software components (I now know how to programmatically interface with Google docs) that might be useful in future projects. &nbsp;</p><p>If you have an idea for a project, I encourage you to build it! Often, working on a project will also help you decide what additional skills to learn, perhaps through coursework. To sustain momentum, it helps to find friends with whom to talk about ideas and celebrate projects — large or small.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep tinkering!&nbsp;<br><br>Andrew&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>P.S.

Text and image input and text-only output are available currently via ChatGPT and API, with image output coming soon. Speech input and output will roll out to paying users in coming weeks. General audio and video will be available first to partners before rolling out more broadly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;GPT-4o is a single model trained on multiple media types, which enables it to process different media types and relationships between them faster and more accurately than earlier GPT-4 versions that use separate models to process different media types. The context length is 128,000 tokens, equal to GPT-4 Turbo but well below the 2-million limit newly set by Google Gemini 1.5 Pro.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The demos are impressive. In a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQacCB9tDaw&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--m4fcSeHyJiOf4e1eGvAF8GwjRy14x6ZFA7G4MfWSSp4-IyUmw-vCQVPjnJ0ispU4C92r2\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a>, one of the model’s four optional voices — female, playful, and extraordinarily realistic — narrates a story while adopting different tones from robotic to overdramatic, translates fluidly between English and Italian, and interprets facial expressions captured by a smartphone camera.</li><li>API access to GPT-4o costs half as much as GPT-4 Turbo: $5 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens.</li><li>GPT-4o is 2x faster than GPT-4 Turbo on a per-token basis and expected to accelerate to 5x (10 million tokens per minute) in high volumes.&nbsp;</li><li>Audio processing is much faster. GPT-4o responds to audio prompts in 0.3 seconds on average, while ChatGPT’s previous voice mode took 2.8 or 5.4 seconds on average relying on a separate speech-to-text step and then GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, respectively.</li><li>An improved tokenizer makes text processing more token-efficient depending on the language. Gujarati, for instance, requires 4.4x fewer tokens, Telegu 3.5x fewer, and Tamil 3.3x fewer. English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish require between 1.1x and 1.3x fewer tokens.</li></ul><p>GPT-4o significantly outperforms Gemini Pro 1.5 at several benchmarks for understanding text, code, and images including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paperswithcode.com/sota/multi-task-language-understanding-on-mmlu?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--m4fcSeHyJiOf4e1eGvAF8GwjRy14x6ZFA7G4MfWSSp4-IyUmw-vCQVPjnJ0ispU4C92r2\" rel=\"noopener\">MMLU</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/openai/human-eval?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--m4fcSeHyJiOf4e1eGvAF8GwjRy14x6ZFA7G4MfWSSp4-IyUmw-vCQVPjnJ0ispU4C92r2\" rel=\"noopener\">HumanEval</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mmmu-benchmark.github.io/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--m4fcSeHyJiOf4e1eGvAF8GwjRy14x6ZFA7G4MfWSSp4-IyUmw-vCQVPjnJ0ispU4C92r2\" rel=\"noopener\">MMMU</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.docvqa.org/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--m4fcSeHyJiOf4e1eGvAF8GwjRy14x6ZFA7G4MfWSSp4-IyUmw-vCQVPjnJ0ispU4C92r2\" rel=\"noopener\">DocVQA</a>.

GPT-4o shows the value of end-to-end modeling for multimodal inputs and outputs, leading to significant steps forward in performance, speed, and cost.
