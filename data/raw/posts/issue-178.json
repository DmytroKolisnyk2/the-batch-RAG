Vision data may fall short within a decade. <br><br><strong>How it works: </strong>The authors compared the future need for, and availability of, unlabeled language and vision data. To evaluate language data, the authors focused on text from sources like Wikipedia, Arxiv, and libraries of digital books. These sources are subject to editorial or quality control, which makes them especially valuable for training large language models. With respect to vision data, they averaged the <a href=\"https://photutorial.com/photos-statistics%20and%20total%20images?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">number of digital images produced</a> and video uploaded to YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp, and Facebook.</p><ul><li>The authors forecast future supplies of unlabeled data by estimating the current sizes of high-quality data sources. They projected each source’s growth rate based on either global population growth, internet penetration, or economic growth (assuming that research and development consumes a fixed percentage of the global economy). Then they summed the sizes of all sources.</li><li>Previous work had found the <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/finding-the-best-data-to-parameter-ratio-for-nlp-models/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">optimal dataset size for a given processing budget</a>. The authors projected the size of datasets required to train future models based on an earlier <a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/projecting-compute-trends?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">projection of processing budgets for machine learning</a>.</li><li>Considering projected data supplies and the dataset sizes required to train future models, they determined when the two would intersect; that is, when available data would fail to meet demand.</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>Dataset sizes needed to train large models will grow much faster than data supplies, the authors concluded.</p><ul><li>The current supply of high-quality language data amounts to 10<sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>13</sup> words, growing at 4 to 5 percent annually. Today’s largest high-quality text datasets, like <a href=\"https://github.com/EleutherAI/pile-cc?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">Pile-CC</a>, already contain roughly 10<sup>12</sup>  words, a figure that will need to double about every 11 to 21 months to keep pace. Thus the supply is likely to fall short between 2023 and 2027.</li><li>Developers of language models can gain a few years of runway by compromising on data quality. The supply of language data rises to around 10<sup>14</sup> to 10<sup>15</sup> words if it includes unedited sources like social media posts, transcribed human speech, and Common Crawl. The authors expect this expanded pool to grow between 6 and 17 percent each year, which could delay the shortage to sometime between 2030 and 2040.</li><li>The supply of vision data amounts to 10<sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>13</sup> images, growing by about 8 percent annually. The largest vision datasets comprise around 10<sup>9</sup> total images and will need to double every 30 to 48 months to keep up.

That’s because it’s hard to describe in a text prompt precisely all the things that distinguish your pet from other members of the same species. A new approach guides diffusion models in a way that can produce pictures of your darling Simba.</p><p><strong>What's new: </strong>Rinon Gal and colleagues at Nvidia and Tel-Aviv University devised a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01618?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">method</a> to make a diffusion-based, text-to-image generator produce pictures of a particular object or in a particular style.</p><p><strong>Basics of diffusion models: </strong>During training, a text-to-image generator based on diffusion takes a noisy image and a text description. A transformer learns to embed the description, and a diffusion model learns to use the embeddings to remove the noise in successive steps. At inference, the system starts with pure noise and a text description, and iteratively removes noise according to the text to generate an image. A variant known as a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">latent diffusion model</a> saves computation by removing noise from a small, learned vector of an image instead of a noisy image.</p><p><strong>Key insight: </strong>A text-to-image generator feeds text word embeddings to an image generator. Adding a learned embedding that represents a set of related images can prompt the generator to produce common attributes of those images in addition to the semantic content of words.</p><p><strong>How it works: </strong>The authors used a <a href=\"https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">text-to-image generator</a> based on a latent diffusion model. The system was pretrained on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02114?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">400 million text-image pairs</a> scraped from the web. Its weights were frozen.</p><ul><li>The authors fed the system three to five images that shared an object (in different rotations or settings) or style (depicting different objects). They also gave it a text description of the images with a missing word denoted by the characters S∗. Descriptions included phrases like “a painting of S∗” or “a painting in the style of S∗”.</li><li>The transformer learned an embedding of S∗, which represented attributes the images had in common.</li><li>Given a prompt that included “S∗” — for instance, “a grainy photo of S∗ in <em>Angry Birds</em>” — the transformer embedded the words and S∗. The latent diffusion model took the embeddings and produced an image.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors evaluated their model’s output by comparing embeddings, generated by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">CLIP</a>, of original and generated images. They measured similarity on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 signifies two identical inputs. The model scored around 0.78. Images generated using human-crafted descriptions of up to 12 words — without reference to S∗ — scored around 0.6. Images generated using longer descriptions of up to 30 words scored around 0.625.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The authors’ method offers a simple way for users of diffusion-based, text-to-image generators to steer the output toward specific attributes of content or style without retraining the model.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>Could this approach be extended to encompass multiple learned vectors and allow users to combine them as they like? That would make it possible to control image generation in even more precise ways.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <strong><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></strong></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-specialization?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/DeepLearning_Mathematics_Campaign_Quotes_Nash.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science banner ad with a quote by John Nash\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/DeepLearning_Mathematics_Campaign_Quotes_Nash.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/DeepLearning_Mathematics_Campaign_Quotes_Nash.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/DeepLearning_Mathematics_Campaign_Quotes_Nash.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>\"You don’t have to be a mathematician to have a feel for numbers,\" said mathematician John Forbes Nash, Jr. Get a feel for the numbers with <em>Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science</em>, our new specialization. <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-specialization?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Join the waitlist</a></p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/unnamed--25-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Some results from the 2022 AI Strategy Report survey by MIT Sloan Management Review\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/unnamed--25-.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/unnamed--25-.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/unnamed--25-.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"ai-as-officemate\">AI as Officemate</h1><p>Many workers benefit from AI in the office without knowing it, a new study found.</p><p><strong>What’s new: </strong>MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group <a href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/achieving-individual-and-organizational-value-with-ai/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">surveyed</a> employees on their use of AI in their day-to-day work.

If AI is the new electricity, we can expect it to be taken for granted, too.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/unnamed--26-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Moving slide with information about AWS AI Service Cards\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/unnamed--26-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"transparency-for-ai-as-a-service\">Transparency for AI as a Service</h1><p>Amazon published a series of web pages designed to help people use AI responsibly.</p><p><strong>What's new: </strong>Amazon Web Services <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-aws-ai-service-cards-a-new-resource-to-enhance-transparency-and-advance-responsible-ai/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">introduced</a> so-called AI service cards that describe the uses and limitations of some models it serves. The move is an important acknowledgment of the need to describe the workings of machine learning models available to the general public.</p><p><strong>How it works: </strong>The company documented three AI models: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/responsible-machine-learning/rekognition-face-matching/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">Rekognition</a> for face matching, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/responsible-machine-learning/textract-analyzeid/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">Textract AnalyzeID</a> for extracting text from documents, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/responsible-machine-learning/transcribe-speech-recognition/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">Transcribe</a> for converting speech to text.</p><ul><li>A section on intended use cases describes applications and risks that confound the model’s performance in each of those applications. For instance, the card for Rekognition lists identity verification, in which the model matches selfies to images in government documents, and media applications, which match faces found in photos or videos to a set of known individuals.</li><li>A section on the model’s design explains how it was developed and tested and describes expectations for performance. It provides information on explainability, privacy, and transparency. It also describes the developer’s efforts to minimize bias. For example, this section for Textract AnalyzeID describes how the developers curated training data to extract text in documents from a wide range of geographic regions.</li><li>A section on deployment offers best practices for customers to optimize the model’s performance. This section for Transcribe suggests that users keep close to the microphone and reduce background noise. It also explains how customers can deploy custom vocabularies to help the model transcribe regional dialects or technical language.</li><li>Amazon will update each service card in response to community feedback. It <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-cards.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">provides</a> resources for customers who build models using SageMaker to create their own cards.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> In 2018, researchers including Margaret Mitchell and Timnit Gebru, who were employed by Google at the time, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">introduced</a> the concept of model cards to document a model’s uses, biases, and performance. Google <a href=\"https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/about?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">implemented</a> a similar approach internally the following year.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Model cards can help users take advantage of AI responsibly. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/customers/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x_IwD1EKUaXPLI7acwKcs11A2asOGcisbTckjxUD2jBUomvMjXHiR1LFcbdkfOX1zCuaF\" rel=\"noopener\">Hundreds of thousands</a> of people use cloud services that offer AI functions including prebuilt models. Knowing what the models were intended to do, what their limitations are, and so on can help users deploy them effectively and avoid misuses that could lead them into ethical or legal trouble.</p><p><strong>We're thinking: </strong>We applaud Amazon’s efforts to increase transparency around their models. We look forward to service cards for more models and, hopefully, tools that help developers increase the transparency of their own models.</p>","comment_id":"63b49ded5f1ee3003d508955","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/ezgif.com-gif-maker--8-.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2023-01-03T13:28:13.000-08:00","updated_at":"2023-02-08T12:09:05.000-08:00","published_at":"2023-01-04T12:38:14.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"The Batch - AI News & Insights: In last week’s issue of The Batch, Yoshua Bengio, Alon Halevy, Douwe Kiela, Been Kim, and Reza Zadeh shared their hopes for AI in 2023.
