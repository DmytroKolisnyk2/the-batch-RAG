In my courses, when it came to math, I’ve sometimes said, “Don’t worry about it.” So why are we offering courses on that very subject?</em></p><p><em>You can learn, build, and use machine learning successfully without a deep understanding of the underlying math. So when you’re learning about an algorithm and come across a tricky mathematical concept, it’s often okay to not worry about it in the moment and keep moving. I would hate to see anyone interrupt their progress for weeks or months to study math before returning to machine learning (assuming that mastering machine learning, rather than math, is your goal).</em></p><p><em>But . . . understanding the math behind machine learning algorithms improves your ability to debug algorithms when they aren’t working, tune them so they work better, and perhaps even invent new ones. You’ll have a better sense for when you’re moving in the right direction or something might be off, saving months of effort on a project. So during your AI journey, it’s worthwhile to learn the most relevant pieces of math, too.</em><br><br><em>If you’re worried about your ability to learn math, maybe you simply haven’t yet come across the best way to learn it. Even if math isn’t your strong suit, I’m confident that you’ll find this specialization exciting and engaging.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/unnamed--31--1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization video teaser\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/unnamed--31--1.gif 600w\"></figure><p><em>Luis is a superb machine learning engineer and teacher of math. He and I spent a lot of time debating the most important math topics for someone in AI to learn. Our conclusions are reflected in three courses:</em></p><ul><li><em><strong>Linear algebra.</strong> This course will teach you how to use vectors and matrices to store and compute on data. Understanding this topic has enabled me to get my own algorithms to run more efficiently or converge better.</em></li><li><em><strong>Calculus.</strong> To be honest, I didn’t really understand why I needed to learn calculus when I first studied it in school. It was only as I started studying machine learning — specifically, gradient descent and other optimization algorithms — that I appreciated how useful it is. Many of the algorithms I’ve developed or tuned over the years would have been impossible without a working knowledge of calculus.</em></li><li><em><strong>Probability and statistics. </strong>Knowing the most common probability distributions, deriving ways to estimate parameters, applying hypothesis testing, and visualizing data all come up repeatedly in machine learning and data science projects. I’ve found that this knowledge often helps me make decisions; for instance, judging whether one approach is more promising than another.</em></li></ul><p><em>Math isn’t about memorizing formulas, it’s about building a conceptual understanding that sharpens your intuition. That’s why Luis, curriculum product manager Anshuman Singh, and the team that developed the courses present them using interactive visualizations and hands-on examples. Their explanations of some concepts are the most intuitive I’ve ever seen.</em></p><p><em>I hope you enjoy the </em><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-specialization/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization</a><em>! </em><br><br><em>Keep learning,</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/unnamed--12-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Microsoft logo (left) and ChatGPT logo (right) reflecting the colors of the Microsoft logo\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/unnamed--12-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/unnamed--12-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/unnamed--12-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"ai-powers-strengthen-ties\">AI Powers Strengthen Ties</h1><p>Microsoft deepened its high-stakes relationship with OpenAI.</p><p><strong>What’s new: </strong>The tech giant <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_2gcX0I5wCL5hfUcVc2J6NzgHosJeJ7BQU6R5_rT_JB5MZZN4w9GaBjt_ECBi18wQTpkUK\" rel=\"noopener\">confirmed</a> rumors that it is boosting its investment in the research lab that created the ChatGPT large language model and other AI innovations.<br><br><strong>What happened: </strong>Microsoft didn’t disclose financial details, but earlier this month anonymous sources had <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/01/09/2023/microsoft-eyes-10-billion-bet-on-chatgpt?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_2gcX0I5wCL5hfUcVc2J6NzgHosJeJ7BQU6R5_rT_JB5MZZN4w9GaBjt_ECBi18wQTpkUK\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> the tech news site <em>Semafor</em> that the company would give OpenAI $10 billion.

To be clear, Sparrow is not Google’s answer to ChatGPT; it preceded OpenAI’s offering by several weeks.</p><p><strong>Key insight: </strong>Given a set of rules for conversation, humans can interact with a chatbot, rate its replies for compliance with the rules, and discover failure cases. Classifiers trained on data generated through such interactions can tell the bot when it has broken a rule. Then it can learn to generate output that conforms with the rules.</p><p><strong>How it works: </strong>Sparrow started with the 70 billion-parameter pretrained <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/finding-the-best-data-to-parameter-ratio-for-nlp-models/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Chinchilla</a> language model. The authors primed it for conversation by describing its function (“Sparrow . . . will do its best to answer User’s questions”), manner (“respectful, polite, and inclusive”), and capabilities (“Sparrow can use Google to get external knowledge if needed”), followed by an example conversation.</p><ul><li>The authors defined 23 rules to make Sparrow helpful, correct, and harmless. For example, it should stay on topic, avoid repetition, and avoid misinformation. It shouldn’t use stereotypes, express preferences or opinions, or pretend to be human.</li><li>During a conversation, Sparrow could choose to add a web-search query (executed by a separate program) and result, and use them when generating its next reply. A chat interface displayed the search result alongside Sparrow’s response as support for the reply.</li><li>The model generated a conversation that included several responses at each conversational turn. Human annotators rated the best response and noted whether it was plausible, whether Sparrow should have searched the web before generating it and, if it had, whether the search result (500 characters that included a snippet — presumably the top one — returned by Google) supported the response.</li><li>They used the ratings to fine-tune a separate Chinchilla language model that, given a query, classified which of several responses a human interlocutor would find plausible and well-supported.</li><li>In addition, they encouraged annotators to lead Sparrow to break a rule. They used the resulting violations to fine-tune a different Chinchilla to classify which rule Sparrow broke, if any.</li><li>The authors fine-tuned Sparrow using <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05862?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_2gcX0I5wCL5hfUcVc2J6NzgHosJeJ7BQU6R5_rT_JB5MZZN4w9GaBjt_ECBi18wQTpkUK\" rel=\"noopener\">reinforcement learning</a> to continue a dialogue and incorporated the feedback from the classifiers as its reward. The dialogues were a mix of questions and answers from <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/P19-1346/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_2gcX0I5wCL5hfUcVc2J6NzgHosJeJ7BQU6R5_rT_JB5MZZN4w9GaBjt_ECBi18wQTpkUK\" rel=\"noopener\">ELI5</a>, conversations between the annotators and past iterations of Sparrow, and dialogues generated by past iterations of Sparrow.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Annotators rated Sparrow’s dialogue continuations as both plausible and supported by evidence 78 percent of the time; the baseline Chinchilla achieved 61 percent. The model broke rules during 8 percent of conversations in which annotators tried to make it break a rule. The baseline broke rules 20 percent of the time.</p><p><strong>Yes, but: </strong>Despite search capability and fine-tuning, Sparrow occasionally generated falsehoods, failed to incorporate search results into its replies, or generated off-topic replies. Fine-tuning amplified certain undesired behavior. For example, on a bias scale in which 1 means that the model reinforced undesired stereotypes in every reply, 0 means it generated balanced replies, and -1 means that it challenges stereotypes in every reply, Sparrow achieved 0.10 on the <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/N18-2002/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_2gcX0I5wCL5hfUcVc2J6NzgHosJeJ7BQU6R5_rT_JB5MZZN4w9GaBjt_ECBi18wQTpkUK\" rel=\"noopener\">Winogender</a> dataset, while Chinchilla achieved 0.06.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The technique known as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_2gcX0I5wCL5hfUcVc2J6NzgHosJeJ7BQU6R5_rT_JB5MZZN4w9GaBjt_ECBi18wQTpkUK\" rel=\"noopener\">reinforcement learning from human feedback</a> (RLHF), in which humans rank potential outputs and a reinforcement learning algorithm rewards the model for generating outputs similar to those that rank highly, is gaining traction as a solution to persistent problems with large language models. OpenAI embraced this approach in training ChatGPT, though it has not yet described that model’s training in detail. This work separated the human feedback into distinct rules, making it possible to train classifiers to enforce them upon the chatbot. This twist on RLHF shows promise, though the fundamental problems remain. With further refinement, it may enable Google to equal or surpass OpenAI’s efforts in this area.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>Among the persistent problems of bias, offensiveness, factual incorrectness, and incoherence, which are best tackled during pretraining versus fine-tuning is a question ripe for investigation.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <strong><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></strong></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-specialization?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/Untitled-design--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization banner ad\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/Untitled-design--1-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/Untitled-design--1-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/01/Untitled-design--1-.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/Untitled-design--1-.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Our new specialization launches today! 🚀 Unlock the full power of machine learning algorithms and data science techniques by learning the mathematical principles behind them in this beginner-friendly specialization. <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-specialization/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Enroll now</a></p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/unnamed--23-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Open water tap providing sentences instead of water\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/unnamed--23-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/unnamed--23-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/unnamed--23-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"generate-articles-publish-errors\">Generate Articles, Publish Errors</h1><p>A prominent tech-news website generated controversy (and mistakes) by publishing articles written by AI.</p><p><strong>What’s new: </strong><em>CNET</em> suspended its practice of publishing articles produced by a text-generation model following news reports that exposed the articles’ authorship, <em>The Verge</em> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/20/23564311/cnet-pausing-ai-articles-bot-red-ventures?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_2gcX0I5wCL5hfUcVc2J6NzgHosJeJ7BQU6R5_rT_JB5MZZN4w9GaBjt_ECBi18wQTpkUK\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>.</p><p><strong>What happened:</strong> Beginning in November 2022 or earlier, CNET’s editors used an unnamed, proprietary model built by its parent company Red Ventures to produce articles on personal finance.

Such labels may not be altered or concealed.</li><li>Providers must dispel false information generated by their models, report incidents to authorities, and keep records of incidents that violate the law.</li><li>Providers are required to review their algorithms periodically.
