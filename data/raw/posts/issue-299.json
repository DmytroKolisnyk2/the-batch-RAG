Starting from K-12, we should teach every student AI enabled coding, since this will enable them to become more productive and more empowered adults. But there is a huge shortage of computer science (CS) teachers. I recently spoke with high school basketball coach Kyle Creasy, who graduated with a B.A. in Physical Education in 2023. Until two years ago, he had never written a line of Python. Now — with help from AI — he not only writes code, he also teaches CS. I found Kyle’s story inspiring as a model for scaling up CS education in the primary- and secondary-school levels.</p><p>Kyle’s success has been with the support of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kira-learning.com/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Yxh0wezWH77b6eE3e5B7ULJmmkulU6xYDSA8iocHZXnCG99Q5ErW4--zvDDDf06rtuhut\" rel=\"noopener\">Kira Learning</a>&nbsp;(an AI Fund portfolio company), whose founders Andrea Pasinetti and Jagriti Agrawal have created a compelling vision for CS education. In K-12 classrooms, teachers play a huge social-emotional support role, for example, encouraging students and helping them when they stumble. In addition, they are expected to be subject-matter experts who can deliver the content needed for their subject. Kira Learning uses digital content delivery — educational videos, autograded quizzes, and AI-enabled chatbots to answer students' questions but without giving away homework answers — so the teacher can focus on social-emotional support. While these are still early days, it appears to be working!</p><p>A key to making this possible is the hyperpersonalization that is now possible with AI (in contrast to the older idea of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Yxh0wezWH77b6eE3e5B7ULJmmkulU6xYDSA8iocHZXnCG99Q5ErW4--zvDDDf06rtuhut\" rel=\"noopener\">flipped classroom</a>, which had limited adoption). For example, when assigned a problem in an online coding environment, if a student writes this buggy line of Python code</p><p>best_$alty_snack = 'potato chips'</p><p>Kira Learning’s AI system can spot the problem and directly tell the teacher that&nbsp;$&nbsp;is an invalid character in a variable name. It can also suggest a specific question for the teacher to ask the student to help get them unstuck, like “Can you identify what characters are allowed in variable names?” Whereas AI can directly deliver personalized advice to students, the fact that it is now helping teachers also deliver personalized support will really help in K-12.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/unnamed--81-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Basketball 3-point shooting chart with AI-generated student portraits and stats for volume and accuracy.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/unnamed--81-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/unnamed--81-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/unnamed--81-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Additionally, agentic workflows can&nbsp;automate a lot of teachers’ repetitive tasks. For example, when designing a curriculum, it’s time-consuming to align the content to educational standards (such as the Common Core in the United States, or the AP CS standard for many CS classes). Having an AI system carry out tasks like these is already proving helpful for teachers.</p><p>Since learning to code, Kyle has built many pieces of software. He proudly showed me an analysis he generated in matplotlib of his basketball players’ attempts to shoot three-pointers (shown above), which in turn is affecting the team’s strategy on the court. One&nbsp;lesson is clear: When a basketball coach learns to code, they become a better basketball coach!</p><p>I talked about Kyle (and other topics) at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.asugsvsummit.com/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Yxh0wezWH77b6eE3e5B7ULJmmkulU6xYDSA8iocHZXnCG99Q5ErW4--zvDDDf06rtuhut\" rel=\"noopener\">ASU+GSV Summit</a>&nbsp;on education.

I’m excited about how AI will lead to new models for K-12 education. By delivering CS education to everyone, I hope that in the future, everyone will be able to build with AI.</p><p>Keep learning!</p><p>Andrew</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/llms-as-operating-systems-agent-memory/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-04-29T103611.308.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Promo banner for: &quot;LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-04-29T103611.308.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-04-29T103611.308.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/04/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-04-29T103611.308.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-04-29T103611.308.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>In “LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory,” you’ll learn to build agents that manage their own memory using the MemGPT approach.

The list&nbsp;purports to highlight the next wave of winners, shedding light on the key executives, investors, fundraising, and valuations behind up-and-coming AI ventures.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The analysts evaluated 17,000 early-stage, private AI companies that had raised funds within the last year&nbsp;and continue to seek further investment.</p><ul><li>CB Insights evaluated the startups according to its own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/marketing/information/Mosaic-Score.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Yxh0wezWH77b6eE3e5B7ULJmmkulU6xYDSA8iocHZXnCG99Q5ErW4--zvDDDf06rtuhut\" rel=\"noopener\">Mosaic Score</a>, a proprietary system designed to assess the health and growth potential of private companies.&nbsp;The score takes into account a startup’s market momentum (traction and growth rate), market size, financial health, and management team.</li><li>The analysts divided their&nbsp;choices into three broad categories: (i) horizontal (providing business products or services common to multiple industries), (ii) vertical (serving a single industry or business function), or (iii) providers of AI hardware or software infrastructure.</li><li>They further divided the horizontal companies by business function (customer service, cybersecurity, software development, and so on), the vertical companies into industries (healthcare, automotive, aerospace, manufacturing, finance, energy, and the like), and the infrastructure providers into segments (hardware, monitoring, data, and development and training).</li></ul><p><strong>Where the action is:</strong>&nbsp;This year’s AI 100 companies are based in 14 countries, around two-thirds of them in the United States. 10 are based in the United Kingdom, five in France, and four in Germany, with one each in Norway (Braintrust), Singapore (Bria), Spain (Cartwheel), Sweden (Chainguard), and Switzerland (Clarium).</p><ul><li>More than 20 percent of this year’s AI 100 build AI agents or support them, including Texas-based Apptronik (valued at $423 million) and Canada’s 1X ($134 million, the second-most highly valued agent specialist).</li><li>The report also notes the rapid growth of companies that monitor AI performance and reliability, such as California-based&nbsp;Arize (valued at $131 million) and the French startup Bioptimus ($76 million).</li><li>Opportunity may be rising for AI companies that cater to specific industries. This year, the vertical companies pulled in the most total funding, just over $1 billion. These included the Texas aerospace specialist Saronic (valued at $4 billion) and the California software development and training provider Together.AI ($3.3 billion).</li><li>The AI infrastructure category raised the second-highest total funding, a leading indicator of need for infrastructure as&nbsp;businesses take advantage of the technology.

Most of the startups listed here offer practical products and services that are poised to deliver a timely return, rather than moonshots with long development cycles and risky payoffs.
