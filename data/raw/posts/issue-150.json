For instance, a new AI system might help democratize access, and at the same time it might be more accessible to people who have internet access than those who don’t. Thus, it could be either praised for helping people or criticized for not helping enough. These days, a determined critic or politician can point to almost anything, good or bad, and find cause to celebrate or denigrate it depending on their agenda.</em></p><p><em>We know from <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00550-7?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">studies</a> of social media that posts that arouse anger are more likely to reach a large audience than those that encourage feelings of contentment. This means that whenever an event occurs — even a good one — naysayers have a larger megaphone than supporters. (This isn’t altogether new. Juicy gossip has always traveled faster than mundane truth.) For example, fear mongering about artificial general intelligence seems to be a persistent meme even though AI’s benefits vastly outweigh its harms.</em></p><p><em>What can we do about this? I’d like to see us do more to support each other. If an uncivil critic has a larger megaphone than we do, we can respond together with a public show of support. When I tweet about some topics — support for Ukraine against Russian aggression, for instance —I find that an occasional hostile response can make me pull back. But I try to ignore the hostility and continue to support the causes that I believe in.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-22-at-9--1-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"People hugging\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-22-at-9--1-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-22-at-9--1-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-22-at-9--1-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>The psychologist John Gottman says that successful relationships have a ratio of <a href=\"https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-magic-relationship-ratio-according-science/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">five positive interactions to one negative interaction</a>. I don't know whether a ratio like this applies to communities, but I would love to hear members of the AI community cheering for each other most of the time — even if, a smaller fraction of the time, we also need to discuss and fix problems that deserve sharp criticism.</em></p><p><em>Over the past couple of years, I’ve seen members of the AI community express a lot of support for one another, but I’ve also noticed a growing tendency to criticize, especially on Twitter. To be clear, AI has many problems including bias, fairness, and harmful use cases, and we need to discuss and fix them.

Rod Brooks, Kai-Fu Lee, Tom Mitchell, and I reminisced about the early days of AI, when everyone knew each other and we often supported each other in the ambitious research directions that many were pursuing. The community continued to welcome newcomers for decades, which allowed us to grow and make a lot of progress.</em></p><p><em>In that spirit, I hope we’ll put more energy into strengthening our community and focus our critical impulses on the most pressing issues.

(In this way, BIG-bench is used to test models, not to fine-tune them.)</li><li>The authors ran the tasks on various sizes of OpenAI’s GPT-3, Google’s <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">PaLM</a>, and dense and sparse varieties of Google’s BIG-G (based on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08239?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">LaMDA</a>).</li><li>They also posed the tasks to a team of humans, who were allowed to search the internet as they performed the tasks.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> No model, regardless of size, outperformed the best-performing human on any task. However, for some tasks, the best-performing model beat the average human. For example, answering multiple-choice questions about Hindu mythology, the best model scored around 76 percent, the average human scored roughly 61 percent, and the best human scored 100 percent (random chance was 25 percent). Generally, larger models performed better than smaller ones.

A new approach effectively trains transformers with an order of magnitude more layers than previous methods.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> A team at Microsoft led by Hongyu Wang and Shuming Ma developed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00555?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">DeepNorm</a>, a normalization function that enables transformers to accommodate up to 1,000 layers. (Their models, dubbed DeepNet, topped out at 3.8 billion parameters.)<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> When training a transformer, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9VkAAjA7SCURo7NBgXN_LSQYamt5y9YwvNCAUg8aaDRvelpJoy9bMLG-ir-kuK3sM_wzaQ\" rel=\"noopener\">layer normalization</a> often is used to scale layer inputs, promoting faster learning. The magnitude of a layer normalization’s input is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04745?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">inversely proportional</a> to the total change in the parameter values of all previous layers in a training step. The authors found that the greater the number of layers, the higher the likelihood of a very large update. This results in larger inputs to layer normalization, so earlier layers receive smaller and smaller updates until parameter values stop changing and performance stops improving. (This issue is related to the familiar vanishing gradient problem, but its cause is different. In the familiar scenario, gradients from later layers diminish as they backpropagate through the network. In this case, the combination of layer normalization and unusually large updates results in significantly smaller gradients.) Limiting the total change in parameter values would prevent large updates, which should enable deeper networks to continue training without getting stuck.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors trained a transformer, applying DeepNorm to the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">residual connections</a> in each attention and feed-forward layer.</p><ul><li>To avoid large parameter updates, DeepNorm scaled up each residual connection’s computation by an author-derived constant. Mathematically, residual connections usually output x+f(x), where f(x) is the function computed by the previous layer. DeepNorm changes them to output a*x+f(x).</li><li>Given the output of the residual connections, DeepNorm applied layer normalization.</li><li>DeepNorm also scaled down the initial parameter values to avoid <a href=\"https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/huang20f.html.?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">large updates in early training</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors evaluated DeepNets of various depths on tasks that involve translating text between English and over 100 other languages. The DeepNets outperformed all competitors of equal depth, between 36 and 1,000 layers, as well as some with an order of magnitude fewer layers (and an order of magnitude more parameters). For instance, <a href=\"https://www.statmt.org/wmt17/translation-task.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">translating English into German and back</a>, a 200-layer DeepNet achieved 28.9 BLEU, while a 200-layer <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01787?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">dynamic linear combination of layers</a> (a state-of-the-art transformer variant) achieved 27.5 BLEU. Seven other 200-layer models, including a transformer without the authors’ modifications, diverged during training. On the [OPUS-100]https://opus.nlpl.eu/opus-100.php multilingual dataset, a DeepNet with 200 layers and 3.2 billion parameters achieved 23.0 BLEU, while M2M-100 (a transformer variant with 48 layers and 12 billion parameters) achieved 18.4 BLEU.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Scaling up neural networks has driven a lot of improvement over the past decade. This work points a way toward even deeper models.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> DeepNets are deep and narrow, making previous models look shallow and wide by comparison.
