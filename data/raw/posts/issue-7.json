The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9bb4e54-dbc1-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\"><em>Financial Times</em></a> snagged a copy before it was taken down, naming machine learning, chemistry, and materials science as likely uses for the technology. Google declined to comment pending the paper‚Äôs official release.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Google designed the special-purpose system, called Sycamore, to determine whether sets of randomly generated numbers were truly random. Researchers estimate that it would have taken the world‚Äôs fastest conventional supercomputer, IBM‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/12/17453918/ibm-summit-worlds-fastest-supercomputer-america-department-of-energy?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Summit</a>, 10,000 years to solve the problem. Sycamore solved it in 3 minutes and 20 seconds, an early demonstration of the capability known as quantum supremacy.</p><ul><li>Instead of bits, quantum computers process information using qubits that can hold the values 1 and 0 simultaneously.</li><li>Qubits can be entangled with one another to represent the totality of all the states of a system‚Äôs qubits.</li><li>For example, two qubits can represent 11, 10, 01, and 00 at once. Three qubits can represent 111, 110, 100, 000, 001, 011, 101 simultaneously, and so on. Sycamore has 53 qubits.</li><li>A major challenge is keeping quantum processors cold enough to prevent ambient heat from disturbing the fragile qubits.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Physicist Paul Benioff wrote a paper in 1980 describing how quantum-mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement could be applied to computing. Google, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft lately have made substantial progress in implementing those ideas.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Quantum computing‚Äôs promise of exponentially faster processing in particular applications has many in the AI community excited to apply it to tasks like search and pattern matching. There‚Äôs no telling when quantum AI will emerge, but when it does, it probably will require new types of models tailored to the peculiar nature of qubits.<br><br><strong>We‚Äôre thinking:</strong> The problem Sycamore solved doesn‚Äôt have much practical value, as computer scientist Scott Aaronson points out in his excellent quantum-supremacy <a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">FAQ</a>.

A new paper proposes a way to anonymize images of faces, purportedly without degrading their usefulness in applications that rely on face recognition.<br><br><strong>What‚Äôs new:</strong> Researchers from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology introduced <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04538.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">DeepPrivacy</a>, a system that anonymizes images of people by synthesizing replacement faces. They also offer the Flickr Diverse Faces dataset, 1.47 million images of faces with supplemental metadata, which they used to train DeepPrivacy.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> The original images are never exposed to the face generator. Authors H√•kon Hukkel√•s, Rudolf Mester, and Frank Lindseth argue that this strategy preserves privacy more effectively than traditional anonymization techniques like pixelizing and blurring.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> DeepPrivacy is a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">conditional generative adversarial network</a> that synthesizes novel images similar to previously observed ones. A discriminator classifies images as real or generated, while a generator based on the U-Net architecture is optimized to create images that fool the generator.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05237?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Single Shot Scale Invariant Face Detector</a> detects faces in images.</li><li>For each face, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Mask R-CNN</a> locates keypoints for eyes, nose, ears, and shoulders.</li><li>Then the faces are replaced with random values.</li><li>The generator architecture receives keypoints, which define the deleted face‚Äôs orientation, and the corresponding faceless images. From these inputs, it learns to create replacement faces that the discriminator can‚Äôt distinguish from real-world images in the training data.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers processed the WIDER-Face dataset (roughly 32,000 images containing around 394,000 faces) using DeepPrivacy as well as traditional anonymization methods. Subjected to traditional techniques, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10220?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Dual Shot Face Detector</a> retained 96.7 percent of its usual performance. With DeepPrivacy, it retained 99.3 percent. The researchers don‚Äôt provide metrics to evaluate the relative degree of anonymity imparted by the various methods.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Laws like the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation set a high bar for data-driven applications by placing tight limits on how personal data can be used. DeepPrivacy transforms photos of people into a less identifiable format that still contains faces recognizable to neural networks.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> DeepPrivacy addresses the privacy implications of faces only. An image purged of faces but still containing, say, clothing with identifiable markings, such as an athlete‚Äôs number, would allow a sophisticated model to infer the wearer‚Äôs identity.<br><br><strong>We‚Äôre thinking:</strong> Machine learning‚Äôs reliance on data is both a gift and a curse. Aggregation of data has allowed for great progress in the field. Yet privacy advocates are inclined to keep personal data under wraps. DeepPrivacy is an intriguing step toward a compromise that could satisfy both AI engineers and users alike.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/basketball2.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Animation showing how players on the opposing team likely would move in response to human-drafted plays\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"nothing-but-neural-net\">Nothing but (Neural) Net</h2><p>Basketball coaches often sketch plays on a whiteboard to help players get the ball through the net.

A coach can draw motion paths for five players represented by dots, as well as ball movements including passes and shots. No dunking, however.</p><ul><li>Once a coach has drawn a play, a generator determines how the five defensive players would react.</li><li>A discriminator evaluates these movements to make sure they match realistic gameplay.</li><li>The model then displays the coach‚Äôs play and the defensive maneuvers.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> A cohort of NBA pros, basketball fans, and basketball non-fans evaluated the generated defenses for realism. While the non-pro fans and non-fans had a hard time spotting the computer‚Äôs defensive plays, the NBA pros could tell they were not designed by a human coach.<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SportVU?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Stat SportVU</a> has collected real time player motion data for the NBA since 2011. The system uses six cameras to collect each player‚Äôs position and track who has possession of the ball, 25 times per second. It uses machine learning to identify events like dribbles and passes, and play types like drives, isolations, and screens.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Pro sports is a high-stakes industry that has embraced technology to optimize performance. It‚Äôs conceivable that a neural network someday might generate AlphaGo-like winning tactics that no human had envisioned.<br><br><strong>We‚Äôre thinking:</strong> This model isn‚Äôt a slam-dunk, given that the pros weren‚Äôt fooled.

Amazon sells the cloud-based face recognition service Rekognition, whose use by law enforcement agencies has raised <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/amazons-face-recognition-falsely-matched-28?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">alarm</a> among civil liberties advocates.<br><br><strong>What it says:</strong> The company has released no details about the model legislation in progress.

He points out that the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs Fourth Amendment and Civil Rights Act of 1964 explicitly outline an individual‚Äôs right to privacy and freedom from discrimination.</li><li>Law enforcement groups, government agencies, and businesses using face recognition should be held to high standards of transparency, the post says.</li><li>Law enforcement should be allowed to use the technology only to narrow down groups of suspects, and only when a model is at least 99 percent confident in its prediction.

But researchers are figuring out how to exert greater control over generated text.<br><br><strong>What‚Äôs new:</strong> Pre-trained text generators generally require fine-tuning for a specific sort of output. A team at Salesforce developed a model aptly named <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05858.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">CTRL</a> that lets users determine the output genre, from news story to horror script, without further training.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> The model is guided by control codes, human-written text tags that describe a desired output genre ‚Äî including, yes, jokes. The model learns relationships between a given code and the intended style and content.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> CTRL, like the state-of-the-art language model BERT, is a modified transformer network trained in an unsupervised fashion on large-scale text corpora. Its training data include Wikipedia, Reddit, and Project Gutenberg‚Äôs library of digitized books.</p><ul><li>CTRL predicts the next word in a sequence based on learned relationships among words.</li><li>During training, each input sequence comes with a control code. For example, material drawn from a contract would be coded Legal.</li><li>During generation, one of these codes directs the model to produce text similar to the associated subset of the training data.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers provide qualitative results demonstrating that control codes generate different styles of text in response to the same prompt. For example, given the prompt ‚Äúthe knife,‚Äù the Reviews code produces ‚Äúa knife is a tool and this one does the job well,‚Äù while the Horror code yields ‚Äúa knife handle pulled through the open hole in the front.‚Äù The paper offers no quantitative evaluation.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The ideal text generator would produce diverse, relevant passages appropriate to a wide variety of uses. CTRL suggests that a single model with unsupervised training could meet this requirement.<br><br><strong>We‚Äôre thinking:</strong> Many people including GPT-2‚Äôs creators worry that more-capable text generators invite misuse.

Some seismologists believe that slow slips shift stress from deep in a geological fault up to the Earth‚Äôs brittle crust, presaging potentially catastrophic quakes.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors began by simulating slow slips in the lab using two sheets of synthetic material, like acrylic plastic, separated by a thin layer of a granular, sandy medium. The video above is a microscopic view of the sheets in action.</p><ul><li>The researchers recorded the acoustic signals emitted by the sheets and granular layer as they compressed. Then they divided the recording into short segments and fed them into a random forest model.</li><li>The model found that the signal‚Äôs gradual variance from mean ‚Äî rather than big, sudden jumps just before a slip ‚Äî was the best predictor that the sheets were about to experience a laboratory version of a slow slip.</li><li>Having ingested seismic data from the tectonic plate that runs from Canada to California between 2007 and 2013, the model predicted four of the five slow slips that occurred between 2013 and 2018.</li></ul><p><strong>We‚Äôre thinking:</strong> Seismologists already provide short-term risk assessments for a given location and time span.
