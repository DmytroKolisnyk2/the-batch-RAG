AI-driven recommendation algorithms, which generally optimize for engagement, can be designed to limit the spread of disinformation. The industry is badly in need of transparent processes designed to reach reasonable decisions that most people can get behind (like free elections in a democracy).

Without the free flow of research, data, talent, and ideas, the field will slow down. Advances in the industry will only benefit the country where they originated, and the worldwide research community will dissolve into clusters of regional cliques. <br><br><strong>Behind the worries:</strong> Restrictive immigration rules have prevented engineers, scientists, and students from pursuing opportunities across national borders. At the same time, global powers have moved to dominate AI through industrial and trade policy, and to limit its reach through social policy.</p><ul><li>Earlier this month, the U.S. government tightened restrictions on H1-B visas, on which many tech companies rely to recruit talented workers from overseas.</li><li>AI researchers from developing countries have also complained about the difficulty of obtaining visas to attend conferences in the U.S. and Canada.</li><li>China requires companies to physically house their data on servers within the country and to pass a regulatory review before moving any of it overseas.</li><li>Last year, the U.S. government banned American firms from doing business with top Chinese AI companies. The U.S. has also intensified scrutiny of transactions between American and foreign companies that might have national security implications.</li></ul><p><strong>How scared should you be:</strong> AI is truly a global effort. The international AI community has a strong tradition of collaboration, and it has built an infrastructure of sharing — including open code, datasets, publications, and conferences — that transcends national boundaries. Yet the aspirations of sovereign states can put the spirit of cooperation at risk. It will take a concerted effort to keep the community alive and thriving, so we can bring the benefits of AI to all people.<br><br><strong>What to do:</strong>  Governments should heed calls by leading AI organizations to make it easier for researchers to gain <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/09/10/partnership-on-ai-governments-should-give-ai-researchers-special-visas-to-attend-conferences/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">visas</a>.

Rising costs will throttle progress as startups, academics, and students — especially in emerging economies — are left out in the cold. Customers will turn away from AI in search of less costly alternatives.<br><br><strong>Behind the worries:</strong> Training a model to beat the top image classification and object detection benchmarks currently costs <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05558?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">millions of dollars</a>. And that cost is rising fast: The processing power required to train state-of-the-art models doubled every 3.4 months between 2012 and 2018, according to a <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io#addendum\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> by OpenAI.</p><ul><li>The high cost of beating the state of the art has prompted some institutions to rethink their approach. OpenAI, founded as a nonprofit lab, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/openai-shifts-from-nonprofit-to-capped-profit-to-attract-capital/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">morphed into a for-profit company</a>. Last month, the organization granted Microsoft an <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/09/22/microsoft-teams-up-with-openai-to-exclusively-license-gpt-3-language-model/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">exclusive commercial license</a> for its GPT-3 language model.</li><li>A European grocery store chain recently decided against deploying an inventory tracking model due the cost in cloud computing charges, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/prepare-artificial-intelligence-produce-less-wizardry/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Wired</em></a> reported.</li><li>AI’s environmental impact is growing as training consumes increasing quantities of energy. A 2019 paper from the University of Massachusetts concluded that training a large language model produced five times as much carbon dioxide as an average car spews over its entire working life.</li></ul><p><strong>How scared should you be:</strong> The massive inflation in training costs arises from trying to beat the best models. If you can make do with something less, the price comes way down. The cost to train an image classification model with Top-5 accuracy of 93 percent on Imagenet fell from $2,523 in 2017 to $13 the following year, according to a Stanford <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/ai_index_2019_report.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a>. Pretrained models like Hugging Face’s <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/models?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">implementations</a> of popular language models and APIs like the one the OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">offers</a> for GPT-3 make access to high-end AI even less expensive.<br><br><strong>What to do:</strong> Researchers at the Allen Institute for AI and elsewhere <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10597?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">argue</a> that we should consider a model’s energy efficiency to be just as important as accuracy.

Systems incorporating biased algorithms or trained on biased data will misdiagnose medical patients, bar consumers from loans or insurance, deny parole to reformed convicts, or grant it to unrepentant ones.<br><br><strong>Behind the worries:</strong> Biased implementations have raised public backlash as organizations both private and public figure out what AI can and can’t do, and how to use it properly.</p><ul><li>The UK recently <a href=\"https://www.statewatch.org/news/2020/august/uk-threat-of-legal-challenge-forces-home-office-to-abandon-racist-visa-algorithm/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">abandoned</a> an algorithm designed to streamline visa applications after human rights activists sued.

Imperceptible changes to a model’s input will lead unaccountably to fickle outputs. Seemingly well-designed systems will produce biased results without warning. People will suffer harm without explanation or recourse.<br><br><strong>Behind the worries:</strong> Decisions made by neural networks are notoriously difficult to explain.
