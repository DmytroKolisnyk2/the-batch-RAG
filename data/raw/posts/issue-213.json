Their counterparts in other Asian countries also rely increasingly on automated anchors.<br><br><strong>Invasion of the newsbots:</strong> Synthetic presenters can deliver reports generated directly by large language models and do so in multiple languages. One news producer noted that they also give newsrooms a break from the typical presenter’s outsized ego. None of the broadcasters has disclosed the technology they’re using.</p><ul><li>In July, Eastern India’s Odia-language Odisha TV introduced <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5NcpmQOu1g%20to%20relay%20breaking%20news%20and%20live%20election%20results&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--y0UYuA5eljmktT-nLaPyIL42--cuhD94XjWxuC6SFyHB8ciBq9z5sISPll9bquR__ztsS\" rel=\"noopener\">Lisa</a>.

Two years later, the broadcaster <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/chinas-latest-ai-news-anchor-mimics-human-voices-and-gestures-in-3d?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--y0UYuA5eljmktT-nLaPyIL42--cuhD94XjWxuC6SFyHB8ciBq9z5sISPll9bquR__ztsS\" rel=\"noopener\">upgraded</a> to 3D-rendered avatars produced using “multimodal recognition and synthesis, facial recognition and animation and transfer learning.”<br><br><strong>Yes, but: </strong>While broadcasters can use AI-generated talking heads to save time and money, propagandists can use them to gain an aura of newsy credibility. For example, an unidentified group <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/disinformation-groups-used-ai-to-spread-propaganda/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">used</a> Synthesia, a web service that makes AI-generated characters, to generate fake news clips from a fictional outlet called Wolf News. One clip attacked the U.S. government for failing to take action against gun violence, while another promoted cooperation between the U.S. and China.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Synthetic presenters potentially multiply the power of broadcast news by generating an unlimited variety of talking heads. They can appeal to specific audience segments by representing any ethnicity, gender, age, or style. And they can reach an even broader audience by speaking a variety of languages — a boon to broadcasters especially in highly multilingual Asian societies.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> It may not be a coincidence that synthetic presenters are appearing first in countries whose people feel more positively about AI.

Tech and non-tech companies alike have posted AI job notices that mention generous salaries. For reference, the average machine learning product engineer job in the U.S. pays around $143,000 annually, according to a study by insurance company Willis Towers Watson.

Yet many come to feel confined by conditions within an established company. Former DeepMinders who formed their own companies cited their desire to follow currents of deep learning, such as generative AI, that their former employer doesn’t emphasize and their need for flexibility to pursue goals that didn’t necessarily revolve around machine learning.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> While high-profile associations often attract capital and attention, great ideas can come from anywhere. They seldom happen overnight; usually, they’re the end result of a long incubation period spent honing them through experimentation and feedback. Start small and develop your intuition, skills, and credibility. That’s how pretty much everyone started who ended up having a huge impact!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/09/unnamed--93-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"601\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/unnamed--93-.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/09/unnamed--93-.gif 601w\"></figure><h1 id=\"different-media-similar-embeddings\">Different Media, Similar Embeddings</h1><p>The ability of OpenAI’s CLIP to produce similar embeddings of a text phrase and a matching image (such as “a photo of a cat” and a photo of a cat) opened up applications like classifying images according to labels that weren’t in the training set. A new model extends this capability to seven data types.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Rohit Girdhar, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Ishan Misra, and colleagues at Meta developed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05665?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--y0UYuA5eljmktT-nLaPyIL42--cuhD94XjWxuC6SFyHB8ciBq9z5sISPll9bquR__ztsS\" rel=\"noopener\">ImageBind</a>, a system that produces similar embeddings of text phrases, audio clips, images, videos, thermal images, depth images, and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) readings (which include accelerometer and gyroscope measurements).</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> One challenge to learning multimodal embeddings is access to training data that includes matched pairs of all data types involved. For instance, matched image-text pairs, image-depth pairs, and image-thermal pairs are readily available, but pairings of text-thermal, text-depth, and so on are not. Learning to produce similar embeddings given pairings of one media type (in this case images) with other media types will transfer to pairings of pairings of that type with further types. There’s no need for specific training for each pairing.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> ImageBind uses a separate transformer to embed each media type with one exception: The transformer that processes images handles video as well by treating a video as a two-frame image (sampled from the video).</p><ul><li>The training data comprised matched pairs of <a href=\"https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45857.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--y0UYuA5eljmktT-nLaPyIL42--cuhD94XjWxuC6SFyHB8ciBq9z5sISPll9bquR__ztsS\" rel=\"noopener\">video-audio</a> clips from YouTube, <a href=\"https://rgbd.cs.princeton.edu/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--y0UYuA5eljmktT-nLaPyIL42--cuhD94XjWxuC6SFyHB8ciBq9z5sISPll9bquR__ztsS\" rel=\"noopener\">image-depth</a> scenes shot by a depth camera, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10831?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--y0UYuA5eljmktT-nLaPyIL42--cuhD94XjWxuC6SFyHB8ciBq9z5sISPll9bquR__ztsS\" rel=\"noopener\">image-thermal</a> pictures of street scenes at night, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07058?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--y0UYuA5eljmktT-nLaPyIL42--cuhD94XjWxuC6SFyHB8ciBq9z5sISPll9bquR__ztsS\" rel=\"noopener\">video-IMU</a> shot from a first-person point of view.</li><li>Instead of training image and text encoders from scratch, the authors adopted the encoders from <a href=\"https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--y0UYuA5eljmktT-nLaPyIL42--cuhD94XjWxuC6SFyHB8ciBq9z5sISPll9bquR__ztsS\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenCLIP</a>, which is pretrained on billions of image-text pairs.</li><li>The transformers learned via a contrastive loss function. Given an image (or video) and its match in another data type, the loss encouraged them to produce similar embeddings.

For example, using the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09387?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--y0UYuA5eljmktT-nLaPyIL42--cuhD94XjWxuC6SFyHB8ciBq9z5sISPll9bquR__ztsS\" rel=\"noopener\">Clotho</a> test set of roughly 1,000 audio and text descriptions, ImageBind compared the embedding of a description with the embedding of every audio clip and returned the most similar audio clip.

However, ImageBind did not match supervised learning. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02192?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--y0UYuA5eljmktT-nLaPyIL42--cuhD94XjWxuC6SFyHB8ciBq9z5sISPll9bquR__ztsS\" rel=\"noopener\">ARNLQ</a>, a supervised model, returned the correct audio 12.6 percent of the time.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The authors’ approach acts as an upgrade for models that generate similar embeddings for examples that have similar meanings in different media: To enhance the model’s repertoire with a new data type (say, audio), simply fine-tune it on relevant paired data (such as image, audio).</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> ImageBind shows that machine learning models don’t need to learn from all pairs of data types to produce similar embeddings among various data types.
