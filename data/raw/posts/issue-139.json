They’re a regular feature in DeepLearning.AI’s courses. But there’s another use of Jupyter Notebooks that I think is under-appreciated: communicating concepts to others.</em><br><br><em>For example, once I was experimenting with a new way to build a neural network in which the input features were engineered a specific way, and I wanted to explain my ideas to colleagues. Writing a text document would have been a reasonable approach, but using a Jupyter Notebook allowed me to format text using its Markdown feature and include an implementation of the idea in code. That way, readers could execute it, experiment with hyperparameters, and add further code to delve more deeply into what the algorithm was doing.</em></p><p><em>When we use a Jupyter Notebook to build a piece of code, the ultimate reader is a computer, whose job is to faithfully execute the program. But when using a Notebook to communicate with people, the goal is to convey an idea and illustrate it with code. The interactive nature of notebooks — which lets you run code snippets to generate outputs, and also lets you add formatted text, equations, graphs, and images — makes this a much richer medium than merely writing code that contains comments.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-05-at-2-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Jupyter Notebooks\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-05-at-2-1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-05-at-2-1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-05-at-2-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>A team I work with recently used a Jupyter Notebook to model their revenue projections.

But if you’re trying to explain a scientific or mathematical equation, simulating a business or other system, or presenting your analysis of data, consider sending your audience a Jupyter Notebook.

But what if training continues? New work found that overfitting isn’t the end of the line.<br><br><strong>What's new:</strong> Training relatively small architectures on an algorithmically generated dataset, Alethea Power and colleagues at OpenAI observed that ongoing training leads to an effect they call <a href=\"https://mathai-iclr.github.io/papers/papers/MATHAI_29_paper.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ukatmzZuodEzJio14_E8aH-z8fRjtmHlW1DvRPnklgQGlkf_UUCmFrb8pqi0C6QH-3f-g\" rel=\"noopener\">grokking</a>, in which a transformer’s ability to generalize to novel data emerges well after overfitting.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> It takes a lot of computation to study how learning progresses over time in models with billions of parameters that train on datasets of millions of examples. It’s equally revealing — and more practical — to study models with hundreds of thousands of parameters that train on thousands of examples. Models on that scale can train through many more steps in far less time.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors trained a set of transformers to classify the solutions to each of 12 two-variable equations, mostly polynomials.</p><ul><li>For each equation, they plugged in the possible values for both variables to find all possible solutions. This yielded roughly 10,000 input-output pairs per expression to be divided between training, test, and validation sets.</li><li>To feed an equation into a transformer, they represented each equation in a form similar to 2*3=6 but substituted each token with a symbol; say, a for 2, m for *, b for 3, q for =, and so on.</li><li>They continued training well beyond the point where training accuracy increased while validation accuracy decreased, a typical indicator for overfitting.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> As the models trained, validation accuracy rose, fell, and —  after the number of training steps continued to rise by a factor of 1,000 — rose a second time. (In the case of modular division, validation accuracy improved from nearly 5 percent to nearly 100 percent). In experiments using reduced datasets, the authors found that the smaller the training set, the more training was needed to achieve the second increase. For instance, when training on 30 percent as many examples, roughly 45 percent more training steps were required.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Grokking may be the way that <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02292?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ukatmzZuodEzJio14_E8aH-z8fRjtmHlW1DvRPnklgQGlkf_UUCmFrb8pqi0C6QH-3f-g\" rel=\"noopener\">double descent</a>, in which a model’s performance improves, worsens, and improves again as the number of parameters or training examples increases, plays out with small models and datasets. That said, this work provides evidence that we've been mistaken about the meaning of overfitting. Models can continue to learn after they overfit and can go on to become quite capable.<br><br><strong>We're thinking:</strong> The authors discovered this phenomenon in a petri dish.

The authors built an algal growth simulator that lets farmers know when to harvest algae to optimize the colony’s density for growth. The training data consisted of grayscale images of algal colonies under six lighting conditions and at 23 intervals over time. Each example included its average algal concentration, and each pixel was labeled with the light intensity.</p><ul><li>The authors trained a separate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-868D-YXjT5eAIoIzXlkWEVl2Na3PsgKSM6ZNj6Bg_p9pNIu664bfyXWBjdkk6pNLkc2zH_\" rel=\"noopener\">support-vector regression</a> (SVR) model for each pixel to estimate the light intensity.</li><li>They further labeled each pixel with the SVR’s estimated light intensity and used the relabeled images to train a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-868D-YXjT5eAIoIzXlkWEVl2Na3PsgKSM6ZNj6Bg_p9pNIu664bfyXWBjdkk6pNLkc2zH_\" rel=\"noopener\">random forest</a> to predict the average growth rate.</li><li>At inference, these techniques combined to predict algal growth. Given a picture of a colony and its initial algal concentration, the SVRs estimated light intensities per pixel, and the random forest used the estimates to determine how the algae would grow.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors found that growth rates across all lighting conditions were at their highest when pixels darkened by algal growth accounted for between 43 percent and 65 percent of an image. They used their system to determine when to harvest indoor and outdoor algae farms. The outdoor farm produced 43.3 grams of biomass per day, the indoor pond 48.1 grams per day. A commercial operation using the authors’ method would produce a biofuel sale price of $281 per ton. That’s comparable to the $260-per-ton price of ethanol derived from corn, which requires expensive processing that algae doesn’t.<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Depending on the species and processing method, algae can be turned into a variety of fuel products including diesel, alcohol, jet fuel, gasoline, hydrogen, and methane. It was first <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/biofuels-from-algae?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-868D-YXjT5eAIoIzXlkWEVl2Na3PsgKSM6ZNj6Bg_p9pNIu664bfyXWBjdkk6pNLkc2zH_\" rel=\"noopener\">proposed</a> as a source of fuel in the 1950s and has been a growing area of sustainable-energy research since the 1970s. However, algal fuels have made little commercial headway due largely to low yields and the cost of processing harvested biomass.<br><br><strong>Why it matters: </strong> Converting algae into fuel is attractive because the biomass is renewable, absorbs as much atmospheric carbon as it emits, and works with internal-combustion engines. To date, it hasn’t scaled well. If machine learning can make it more productive, it could revitalize this approach to alternative energy.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Between this work, Fraunhofer Institute’s similar
