The ultimate winners are yet to be determined, and already the current dynamics are exciting. Let me share a few observations, focusing on direct-to-consumer chat interfaces and the LLM infrastructure and application layers.</em></p><p><em>First, ChatGPT is a new category of product. It’s not just a better search engine, auto-complete, or something else we already knew. It overlaps with other categories, but people also use it for entirely different purposes such as writing and brainstorming. Companies like Google and Microsoft that are integrating LLMs into existing products may find that the complexity of switching not only technologies but also product categories raises unique challenges.</em></p><p><em>OpenAI is clearly in the lead in offering this new product category, and ChatGPT is a compelling direct-to-consumer product. While competitors are emerging, OpenAI’s recent move to have ChatGPT support third-party plugins, if widely adopted, could make its business much more defensible, much like the app stores for iOS and Android helped make those platforms very defensible businesses.</em></p><p><em>Second, the LLM infrastructure layer, which enables developers to interact with LLMs via an API, looks extremely competitive. OpenAI/Microsoft leads in this area as well, but Google and Amazon have announced their own offerings, and players such as Hugging Face, Meta, Stability AI, and many academic institutions are busy training and releasing open source models. It remains to be seen how many applications will need the power of the largest models, such as GPT-4, versus smaller (and cheaper) models offered by cloud providers or even hosted locally, like <a href=\"https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_NI0riVg2MTygpGvzNa7DXL56dJ2LjHkJoe2AkDTfZfN8MvbcNRAimpQmPvjNrJ9gp98d6\" rel=\"noopener\">gpt4all</a>, which runs on a desktop.</em></p><p><em>Finally, the application layer, in which teams build on top of LLMs, looks less competitive and full of creativity. While many teams are piling onto “obvious” ideas — say, building question-answering bots or summarizers on top of online content — the sheer diversity of potential LLM-powered applications leaves many ideas relatively unexplored in verticals including specialized coaching and robotic process automation. <a href=\"http://aifund.ai/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_NI0riVg2MTygpGvzNa7DXL56dJ2LjHkJoe2AkDTfZfN8MvbcNRAimpQmPvjNrJ9gp98d6\" rel=\"noopener\">AI Fund</a>, the venture studio I lead, is working with entrepreneurs to build applications like this. Competition feels less intense when you can identify a meaningful use case and go deep to solve it.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-19-at-11.26.21-AM-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-19-at-11.26.21-AM-1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-19-at-11.26.21-AM-1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-19-at-11.26.21-AM-1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>LLMs are a <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/generative-ai-will-drive-tremendous-value-and-growth/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">general-purpose technology</a> that’s making many new applications possible. Taking a lesson from an earlier era of tech, after the iPhone came out, I paid $1.99 for an app that turned my phone into a flashlight. It was a good idea, but that business didn’t last: The app was easy for others to replicate and sell for less, and eventually Apple integrated a flashlight into iOS. In contrast, other entrepreneurs built highly valuable and hard-to-build businesses such as AirBnB, Snapchat, Tinder, and Uber, and those apps are still with us. We may already have seen this phenomenon in generative AI: <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/whats-going-on-with-lensa-the-ai-powered-selfie-app?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Lensa</a> grew rapidly through last December but its revenue run appears to have collapsed.</em></p><p><em>Today, in a weekend hackathon, you can build a shallow app that does amazing things by taking advantage of amazing APIs. But over the long term, what excites me are the valuable solutions to hard problems that LLMs make possible. Who will build generative AI’s lasting successes? Maybe you!</em></p><p><em>One challenge is that the know-how for building LLM products is still evolving. While academic studies are important, current research offers a limited view of how to use LLMs. As the InstructGPT <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_NI0riVg2MTygpGvzNa7DXL56dJ2LjHkJoe2AkDTfZfN8MvbcNRAimpQmPvjNrJ9gp98d6\" rel=\"noopener\">paper</a> says, “Public NLP datasets are not reflective of how our language models are used. . . .  [They] are designed to capture tasks that are easy to evaluate with automatic metrics.”</em></p><p><em>In light of this, community is more important than ever. Talking to friends who are working on LLM products often teaches me non-intuitive tricks for improving how I use them. I will continue trying to help others wherever I can.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p><em>P.S. On Tuesday April 25, 2023, I’ll share early ideas on Visual Prompting in a livestream on behalf of my team Landing AI. LLMs let users enter a text prompt and quickly get a text output, which has transformed natural language processing. I’m excited about taking these ideas from text to computer vision so we can let users enter a visual prompt (labeling a few pixels) and quickly get a visual output.

So how can you come up with the best one? A new model automates the process.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Yongchao Zhou, Andrei Ioan Muresanu, Ziwen Han, and colleagues at University of Toronto, Vector Institute, and University of Waterloo developed a procedure for generating effective text to prompt large language models: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01910?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_NI0riVg2MTygpGvzNa7DXL56dJ2LjHkJoe2AkDTfZfN8MvbcNRAimpQmPvjNrJ9gp98d6\" rel=\"noopener\">Automatic Prompt Engineer</a> (APE).</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Given a handful of input-output pairs, a large language model can generate a prompt that, along with the same inputs, would result in the similar outputs. Moreover, having produced a prompt, it can generate variations that may result in even more similar outputs.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> APE requires two large language models: a prompt generator (which produces prompts) and a content generator (which, given a prompt, produces output). For the prompt generator, they tried both language models that complete inputs (such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_NI0riVg2MTygpGvzNa7DXL56dJ2LjHkJoe2AkDTfZfN8MvbcNRAimpQmPvjNrJ9gp98d6\" rel=\"noopener\">GPT-3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/a-kinder-gentler-language-model/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">InstructGPT</a>) and those that fill in blanks in inputs (such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_NI0riVg2MTygpGvzNa7DXL56dJ2LjHkJoe2AkDTfZfN8MvbcNRAimpQmPvjNrJ9gp98d6\" rel=\"noopener\">T5</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10360?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_NI0riVg2MTygpGvzNa7DXL56dJ2LjHkJoe2AkDTfZfN8MvbcNRAimpQmPvjNrJ9gp98d6\" rel=\"noopener\">GLM</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14255?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_NI0riVg2MTygpGvzNa7DXL56dJ2LjHkJoe2AkDTfZfN8MvbcNRAimpQmPvjNrJ9gp98d6\" rel=\"noopener\">InsertGPT</a>). For the content generator, they used InstructGPT.</p><ul><li>The authors fed the prompt generator a prompt such as, “I gave a friend an instruction and five inputs. The friend read the instruction and wrote an output for every one of the inputs. Here are the input-output pairs:” followed by a small set of example inputs and outputs, such as the names of two animals and which one is larger, from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10782?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_NI0riVg2MTygpGvzNa7DXL56dJ2LjHkJoe2AkDTfZfN8MvbcNRAimpQmPvjNrJ9gp98d6\" rel=\"noopener\">Instruction Induction</a>. After the example inputs and outputs, the prompt concluded, “The instruction was &lt;COMPLETE&gt;”.  The prompt generator responded with a prompt such as “Choose the animal that is bigger.”</li><li>They fed the generated prompt plus 50 example inputs from the dataset to the content generator, which generated outputs.</li><li>They scored the prompt’s quality based on how often the content generator produced outputs that exactly matched the expected outputs.</li><li>They sharpened the prompt by asking the prompt generator to produce a prompt similar to the highest-scoring one (“Generate a variation of the following instruction . . . ”) and repeated the process. They performed this step three times. For example, a higher-scoring variation of the earlier prompt example is “Identify which animal is larger”.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Earlier <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10782?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_NI0riVg2MTygpGvzNa7DXL56dJ2LjHkJoe2AkDTfZfN8MvbcNRAimpQmPvjNrJ9gp98d6\" rel=\"noopener\">work</a> on automated prompt engineering used large language models to generate prompts but didn’t iteratively refine them. In 19 out of the 24 tasks in Instruction Induction, prompts generated by InstructGPT using APE outperformed the earlier work as well as human-engineered prompts according to Interquartile Mean (IQM), the mean exact-match accuracy after discarding the lowest and the highest 25 percent. On all 24 tasks, prompts produced by InstructGPT using APE achieved 0.765 IQM, while human prompts achieved 0.749 IQM. By optimizing measures of truthfulness and informativeness, the method produced prompts that steered the content generator to produce output with those qualities. For instance, on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_NI0riVg2MTygpGvzNa7DXL56dJ2LjHkJoe2AkDTfZfN8MvbcNRAimpQmPvjNrJ9gp98d6\" rel=\"noopener\">TruthfulQA</a>, a question-answering dataset that tests for truthful and informative answers, answers produced by InstructGPT using APE were rated true and informative 40 percent of the time, while answers produced using prompts composed by humans achieved 30 percent (although the generated answers produced by InstructGPT using APE often take shortcuts such as “no comment,” which has high truthfulness but little information).</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> As researchers develop new large language models, APE provides a systematic way to get the most out of them.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Prompt engineers have only existed for a few years, and already robots are coming for their jobs!</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong>Canada investigates OpenAI</strong><br>The Canadian Office of the Privacy Commissioner announced a probe of ChatGPT’s maker in response to complaints about the chatbot’s collection and use of personal information.
