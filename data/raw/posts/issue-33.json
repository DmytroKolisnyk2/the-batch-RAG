A new paper contributes equations that optimize some training parameters.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Jared Kaplan and Sam McCandlish led researchers at Johns Hopkins and OpenAI to derive <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">equations</a> that describe the effects of parameter count, training corpus size, batch size, and training time on language model performance, plus their own ways to find the best model and dataset sizes.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> The researchers devised a set of equations that approximate the effects of different combinations of two variables. It’s easier to reason about 2D graphs than to visualize an n-dimensional surface.</p><p><strong>Findings:</strong> Three findings stand out. First, as many researchers have suspected, transformers outperform LSTMs when trained to convergence. Second, where data and compute are limited, it’s more efficient to train a large model in fewer training steps than to train a smaller model to convergence. Third, some researchers have conjectured that exceeding a so-called critical batch size degrades performance. The researchers offer a way to find optimal batch sizes.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers trained many model shapes and sizes on various subsets of a proprietary <a href=\"https://github.com/jcpeterson/openwebtext?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">dataset</a> of Reddit posts and linked articles. They measured performance of every combination during training to track the impact of design choices on performance.</p><ul><li>They derived a slightly different formula for loss as a function of model and data size than recent MIT <a href=\"https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryenvpEKDr&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">research</a>, but they found a similar relationship: Increasing either parameter count or dataset size improves performance to a point, but then the gains level off. They established a similar relationship between model size and number of training steps.</li><li>The equation that evaluates loss for a given parameter count and numbers of training steps revealed a lower boundary on the number of training steps necessary for early stopping to prevent overfitting. As you might expect, the number of training steps before overfitting rises with dataset size.</li><li>Optimal batch size depends on the model’s loss, they found, not parameter count or dataset size. Optimal batch size rises as the loss decreases.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Most machine learning practitioners don’t have the seemingly infinite computational resources that some large companies do. These insights should help them use resources more effectively.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Natural language processing is notoriously compute-hungry. The ability to balance processing power against performance could not only save money but reduce <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">environmental impacts</a>.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bombs2.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Map seen with computer vision\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"where-are-the-live-bombs\">Where Are the Live Bombs?</h2><p>Unexploded munitions from past wars continue to kill and maim thousands of people every year.

The researchers built a tool that counts craters — evidence of bombs that <em>did</em> explode — and then subtracted that number from the total number dropped. The difference enabled them to estimate how many bombs still litter the countryside.</p><ul><li>The researchers hand-labeled 49 craters in satellite imagery, along with 108 other circular objects (such as trees and rice silos) within a 1.5 square kilometer training area. By flipping and rotating the crater images, they increased the training dataset to 1,256 total labeled images.</li><li>The craters can be hard to spot, blurred by decades of erosion and overgrowth and often filled with water. So the researchers developed a two-step model that first identifies potential craters and then culls false positives.</li><li>Step one picked out everything that was circular enough to look vaguely like a crater. It identified 1,229 candidates in the validation area of 9.2 square kilometers (the image with more blue dots in the animation above).</li><li>In step two, the model compared the candidates’ color, shape, size, and texture with craters in the labeled data. Using a decision tree, it correctly identified 152 of 177 verified craters in the area (the image with fewer blue dots).</li></ul><p><strong>The results:</strong> The researchers used their model to sweep a 100 square kilometer area near the Vietnamese border that had been slammed with 3,205 bombs during the war. Using multiple runs of their model, the researchers found between 1,405 to 1,618 craters, which suggests that up to half of all the bombs dropped in this area are still waiting to be found.<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> In 1969, U.S. President Richard Nixon secretly ordered the Air Force to begin bombing Cambodia to disrupt Viet Cong supply lines. The campaign left between 50,000 and 150,000 <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/sep/11/henry-kissinger/kissinger-drones-have-killed-more-civilians-bombin/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">dead</a>.

A new method sees such items more accurately.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Shreeyak Sajjan and researchers at Synthesis.ai, Google, and Columbia University premiered a state-of-the-art model for identifying transparent objects. They call it <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02550?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">ClearGrasp</a>, a reference to its intended use in robotics.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Faced with a transparent object, RGB-D cameras, which sense color and depth per pixel, can get confused: They take some depth measurements off the object’s surface, others straight through the object. ClearGrasp recognizes such noisy measurements and uses them to predict an object’s shape. Once it knows the object’s shape and how far away one point is, it can infer how far away every point is.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> ClearGrasp incorporates a trio of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02611?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Deeplabv3+</a> models with the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09914?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">DRN-D-54</a> architecture.</p><ul><li>ClearGrasp’s training dataset included 18,000 simulated and 22,000 real images.

Among the beneficiaries are companies like <a href=\"https://www.alation.com/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Alation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.collibra.com/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Collibra</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.starburstdata.com/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Starburst Data</a> that help catalog, query, and manage machine learning data, <a href=\"https://mattturck.com/2019trends/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">writes</a> investor Matt Turck.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Toews believes there are billions of dollars to be made by companies that provide machine learning services. Such services will also nurture new AI applications and accelerate their adoption across a variety of industries.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> These companies aren’t only promising businesses. By taking on tasks like data procurement, model optimization, and lifecycle management, they could free engineers to focus on building products that fulfill deep learning’s potential.</p>","comment_id":"60c0520c274d5b003b1066f3","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/06/Resources20ASPECT.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2021-06-08T22:30:52.000-07:00","updated_at":"2023-01-24T11:26:04.000-08:00","published_at":"2020-04-01T12:00:00.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"In the earlier weeks of Covid-19, I didn’t want to contribute noise, so that experts in infectious disease could be heard.
