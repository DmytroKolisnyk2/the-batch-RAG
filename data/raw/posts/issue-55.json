When the models detect another plane or an obstacle, they funnel the information to a rules-based flight control system, which adjusts course, Xwing CEO Marc Piette told <em>The Batch</em>.</p><ul><li>The company installed its system aboard a fleet of Cessna Grand Caravans modified with extra sensors and computing power. These propeller-driven planes typically carry around 3,300 pounds of freight over relatively short distances.</li><li>Sensors mounted on the aircraft include electro-optical and infrared cameras, radar, lidar, and GPS. Some sensors capture annotated data; for example, radar labels other aircraft. This allows automated annotation of camera images, enabling the company to generate large datasets quickly and save on manual annotation.</li><li>Human pilots sit in the cockpit as emergency backups. Xwing hopes to make the system fully autonomous with oversight by people on the ground, who can take control if necessary.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Several companies are racing toward regulatory approval for autonomous freight transport, including Amazon, which this week gained permission to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/31/amazon-prime-now-drone-delivery-fleet-gets-faa-approval.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">deliver packages using drones</a>. The remaining issues are not technical. Commercial airliners routinely fly on autopilot, and last year a Cessna outfitted with an AI-powered autopilot from <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/08/26/space-x-tesla-reliable-robotics-autonomous-airplanes/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Reliable Robotics</a> performed the first autonomous take-off, flight, and landing over an urban area. However, regulations and public concerns have kept human pilots in cockpits. Xwing and its proponents believe that restriction may lift before long, starting with approval for flights over water or uninhabited areas. The company’s reliance on existing aircraft may help expedite the process.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Small planes move cargo <a href=\"https://crp.trb.org/acrp0331/the-players-in-the-air-cargo-industry/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">between outlying areas and central hubs</a>.

A new approach reorganizes the process to run efficiently on the chips that typically run neural network calculations.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Pascal Notin and colleagues at Oxford and Cohere.ai introduced an alternative, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10909?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">SliceOut</a>, that boosts neural network speed with little or no compromise to accuracy.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Most operations in deep learning consist of multiplying a matrix of weights by a vector of activations or features. Deleting an input feature means a row of the weight matrix has no effect. Similarly, deleting an output feature means a column has no effect. But the resulting matrix forces the chip that’s processing the calculations to shuttle data in and out of memory, which takes time. By deleting — and keeping — only features that are contiguous in memory, the authors avoided time-consuming memory reallocations.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> In its simplest form, dropout zeroes out a random selection of parameter values or, equivalently, by zeroing out the corresponding weights.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7881693?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Controlled dropout</a> saves some processing power by collecting the remaining non-zero weights into a new, smaller weight matrix — but that still requires reallocating memory.</li><li>SliceOut selects contiguous portions of the matrix and zeroes out everything else. This scheme is massively more efficient.</li><li>By analyzing how GPUs compute convolutional and transformer layers, the authors developed SliceOut variants for those layers as well.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers evaluated SliceOut in an image-recognition task using CNNs trained on <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">CIFAR-100</a>, SliceOut matched dropout’s test accuracy but ran trained 33.3 percent faster and required 27.8 percent less memory.

They used <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Mask R-CNN</a> to find every pixel in each video frame that corresponds to the player and his or her racket. Then <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03872?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Deep Image Matting</a> turned the pixels into sprites. Additional preprocessing made the sprites more consistent.</li><li>Rather than control the players manually, users can leave it to the behavioral models. These models are made up of kernel density estimators, a type of non-parametric model similar to a histogram.</li><li>The clip search finds a video segment that best matches the selected movements and shots. The rendering module paints the appropriate sprite onto a virtual tennis court.</li><li>Vid2Player continues to generate player motions until one player makes a mistake or fails to return the ball.</li></ul><p><strong>Realistic rallies:</strong> Five tennis experts who evaluated Vid2Player said it produced more realistic action than previous efforts.

However, they don’t search for clips that most closely match what a player would do in a given situation.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Apart from filling the hole in this year’s tennis season, simulations like this could allow fans to create never-before-seen matchups like Federer versus Williams.

But they can run slowly when they’re applied to long sequences. New research converts transformers into functional RNNs for a major speed boost.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Angelos Katharopoulos and colleagues at Idiap Research Institute, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and University of Washington accelerated transformers nearly a thousand-fold by outfitting them with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16236?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">linear attention</a>.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Researchers have used transformers instead of RNNs to analyze sequences, primarily <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">sequences of words</a> but also <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">sequences of pixels</a>. However, the number of calculations performed by the straightforward implementation of a transformer rises quadratically as sequence length increases, while calculations performed by RNNs rise linearly. The authors modified a transformer to act like an RNN’s hidden state. This modification, along with a clever speedup, allows the transformer’s computations to scale linearly with sequence length.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Transformers extract features that capture the relationship between elements in the sequence. These features depend on comparisons between a single token to every other token in the sequence.</p><ul><li>The authors noticed that similarities among tokens could be reformulated as a dot product in an alternative feature space (a technique known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">kernel trick</a>).</li><li>The kernel trick enables linear attention to combine intermediate calculations into a single matrix that’s shared among all feature comparisons. The matrix’s size remains constant regardless of the number of tokens in the sequence, which avoids the quadratic slowdown.</li><li>To mimic an RNN, the researchers compared the latest input token only to earlier tokens rather than all tokens in a sequence. This technique, called causal masking, lets the transformer reuse the matrix in consecutive time steps instead of recomputing the entire layer as usual. Thus the matrix acts like the hidden state of an RNN.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Linear attention generated synthetic <a href=\"http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">MNIST</a> images over 400 times faster than <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Reformer</a>, the pace-setting transformer in this task. And it was more accurate, too. In speech recognition on the <a href=\"https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC94S13A?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">WSJ</a> dataset, linear attention achieved a lower error rate (8 percent) compared to both Reformer (9.3 percent) and a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01991?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">bi-LSTM</a> (10.9 percent).<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This work demonstrated advantages over typical transformers without incurring any apparent costs.
