The $43-billion bid was motivated, he said, by his desire to protect free speech endangered by the company’s practice of promoting some tweets while burying others. To that end, he proposes publishing the company’s ranking algorithm, the program that decides which tweets appear in a given user’s feed.</em></p><p><em>Social media companies generally keep their ranking algorithms secret. Let’s take a look at some pros and cons of letting people see what these companies are doing behind the scenes.</em><br><br><em>Why keep ranking algorithms secret?</em></p><ul><li><em>Keeping the algorithm secret arguably makes it harder for scammers and spammers to manipulate its output. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x1u8iiVdztrPz7MsKz--4T7G3-b8L3RsGWCtkvf1hnN-nqvoAD_zpR8XSKjCoNR3kavee\" rel=\"noopener\">Security through obscurity </a>can’t be the only defense, but it is one barrier. It’s true, open source software can be highly secure because public scrutiny reveals holes to be patched. But I think there’s a difference between defending traditional software from hackers and defending a ranking algorithm from statistical manipulation. Rather than probing a live website, which may alert the security team, attackers can repeatedly probe an offline copy of the algorithm to find message formats that it’s likely to promote.</em></li><li><em>Crucially, if the point is to enable people to understand how a learning algorithm works, then publishing it also requires publishing the data that drives it — the system’s behavior depends on both. But releasing Twitter’s data isn’t practical. One reason is the massive size of the dataset. Another is the company’s obligation to protect users’ privacy when the dataset presumably includes intimate details like user locations, interests, and times of use.</em></li><li><em>Even if both the code and the data were available, the algorithm’s behavior would still be very difficult to analyze due to the black-box nature of machine learning.</em></li><li><em>Proprietary algorithms confer a competitive advantage. Twitter developed its ranking algorithm at great time and expense, and it’s an important part of what differentiates the company from competitors. Publishing it would give rivals a leg up.</em></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-19-at-6.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Twitter logo scaping from a cage\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-19-at-6.webp 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-19-at-6.webp 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-19-at-6.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>On the other hand, there are clear benefits to making ranking algorithms public.</em></p><ul><li><em>Researchers and the broader public could gain more insight into how the algorithms work, spot problems, and evaluate the provider’s neutrality.

The number of acquisitions jumped from 48 to 72 in that period. The <em>Journal</em> focused on two chatbot deals: Gupshup’s purchase of Active.ai and Observe.AI’s acquisition of Scope.AI.</p><ul><li>Snapping up other companies may be a way for the acquirers to attract further investment at a time when venture funding is becoming scarce.

Initial public offerings and fundraising by special-purpose acquisition companies tumbled 45 percent in the same period.</li><li>AI startups make a ready source of engineering talent for companies looking to beef up their technical capabilities, said Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner of Work-Bench, a venture investor. Startups are facing a worldwide <a href=\"https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/help-wanted-ai-developers/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">shortage</a> of AI engineers.</li><li>The wave of acquisitions is also affecting startup finance departments. Early-stage companies are hiring investment bankers and corporate development specialists, according to Andrew Gazdecki, chief executive of MicroAcquire, which specializes in helping startups buy other startups.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> All told, investors are spending more than ever on AI. Private investments in AI more than doubled to $93 billion in 2021 from $42 billion in 2019, according to the <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index-2021?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x1u8iiVdztrPz7MsKz--4T7G3-b8L3RsGWCtkvf1hnN-nqvoAD_zpR8XSKjCoNR3kavee\" rel=\"noopener\">Stanford AI Index</a>. However, they’re also becoming choosier about where they put their money. The number of newly funded AI companies worldwide fell from 1,200 to 746 between 2018 and 2021.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> AI continues to be hot in the startup world — so hot that startups themselves want more of it. The current wave of purchases suggests that startups not only want to expand their AI holdings, they consider purchasing AI companies a strategic way to broaden their markets.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Ultimately, young companies have to make money by creating long-term value, but the route may not be direct. For instance, we’ve seen self-driving car startups that have little in the way of products or revenue thrive by serving other self-driving car startups. This is part of the value of venture capital: It gives companies the time and resources they need to (hopefully) create massive value.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/04/MRKL.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Jurassic-X's software infrastructure\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/MRKL.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/MRKL.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/04/MRKL.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"neural-nets-rules-truer-text\">Neural Nets + Rules = Truer Text</h1><p>A new approach aims to cure text generators of their tendency to produce nonsense.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> AI21 Labs launched Jurassic-X, a natural language processing system that combines neural networks and rule-based programs.

However, these deals may not benefit typical home buyers.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Unlike traditional real estate agents who determine a property’s value by considering the selling prices of similar properties nearby, iBuyers use models that estimate prices based on a variety of factors including national real-estate listings, mortgages, reviews of local businesses, and human assessments.</p><ul><li>The top four iBuyers accounted for 95 percent of all iBuyer purchases between 2017 and early 2021, the most recent time frame for which data is available. Opendoor bought 56 percent of those homes, Zillow 24 percent, Offerpad 18 percent, and Redfin 2 percent. (Zillow shuttered its iBuying division after <a href=\"https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-118/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x1u8iiVdztrPz7MsKz--4T7G3-b8L3RsGWCtkvf1hnN-nqvoAD_zpR8XSKjCoNR3kavee\" rel=\"noopener\">incurring a huge loss</a> amid the pandemic, which disrupted housing prices and confounded its algorithm.)</li><li>In that time, 75 percent of iBuyer purchases took place in five states: Arizona, Texas, Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. Their models can have difficulty estimating the value of properties that are older or atypical, so they tend to operate in cities with large numbers of newer, homogenous homes, according to CoreLogic.</li><li>In February, Opendoor <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/13/1049227/house-flipping-algorithms-are-coming-to-your-neighborhood/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x1u8iiVdztrPz7MsKz--4T7G3-b8L3RsGWCtkvf1hnN-nqvoAD_zpR8XSKjCoNR3kavee\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> <em>MIT Technology Review</em> that its model could assess homes in locales that are harder to price, such as gated or age-restricted communities, and in cities that offer more varied property types including older buildings, multiplexes, and condos, such as San Francisco.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> iBuyers sell 20 percent of their stock to institutional investors like banks and private equity funds rather than individuals or families, according to a January <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-01-07/buying-starter-homes-gets-harder-as-wall-street-uses-zillow-to-buy-thousands?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8x1u8iiVdztrPz7MsKz--4T7G3-b8L3RsGWCtkvf1hnN-nqvoAD_zpR8XSKjCoNR3kavee\" rel=\"noopener\">analysis</a> by <em>Bloomberg News</em>. These investors, in turn, often sell the houses to landlords as rental properties.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Automated pricing can make markets more efficient. It can also bring unintended consequences. While iBuyers pitch their services as a way to streamline the Byzantine process of selling and buying houses, they often end up funneling homes into the rental market.
