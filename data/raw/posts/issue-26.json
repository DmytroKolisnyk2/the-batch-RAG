A Tesla on autopilot and a Renault equipped with Intel Mobileye’s assistive driving system — which rely on sensors like cameras and radars rather than three-dimensional lidar — responded by swerving, stopping, or slowing (as you can see in the lower left-hand corner of the clip above).

A new neural network helps pick the most appealing shots.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Agastya Kalra and Ben Peterson run a business called Photofeeler that helps customers choose portraits for dating and other purposes. Their model <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07435?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Photofeeler-D3</a> rates perceived looks, intelligence, and trustworthiness in photos. You can watch a video demo <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0UdpZV0OXws?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">here</a>.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Individuals have biases when it comes to rating photos. Some consistently give higher scores than average, while others may consistently give more random scores. By taking into account individual raters’ biases, a model can predict more accurately how a group would judge a photo. <br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Photofeeler-D3 scores the beauty, intelligence, and trustworthiness of a person in a photo on a scale of 1 to 10. The network was trained on more than 10 million ratings of over 1 million photos submitted by customers through the company website.</p><ul><li>Photofeeler-D3 learned each rater’s bias (that is, whether the person’s ratings tend to be extreme or middling) based on their rankings of photos in the training dataset. The model represents this individual bias as a vector.</li><li>A convolutional neural network using the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">xception</a> architecture learned to predict a score for each trait. (The score wasn’t used.) After training, the CNN used its knowledge to generate vector representations of input images.</li><li>The model samples a random rater from the training dataset. An additional feed-forward layer predicts that rater’s scores using the bias vector and photo vector.</li><li>Then it averages its predictions of 200 random raters to simulate an assessment by the general public.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Tested on a <a href=\"https://figshare.com/articles/Face_Research_Lab_London_Set/5047666?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">dataset</a> of face shots scored for attractiveness, Photofeeler’s good-looks rating achieved 81 percent correlation compared to the <a href=\"https://www.prettyscale.com/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">previous</a> state of the art, 53 percent. On the researchers’ own dataset, the model achieved 80 percent correlation for beauty, intelligence, and trustworthiness.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Crowdsourced datasets <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07898?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">inherit the biases</a> of the people who contributed to them. Such biases add noise to the training process. But Photofeeler’s voter modeling turns raters’ bias into a benefit: Individuals tend to be consistent in the way they respond to other peoples’ looks, so combining individuals yields a more accurate result than estimating mean ratings while ignoring their source. <br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>We’d rather live in a world where a link to your Github repo gets you the most dates.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corona2052020ASPECT.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Covid-19 illustration\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"tools-for-a-pandemic\">Tools For a Pandemic</h2><p>Chinese tech giants have opened their AI platforms to scientists fighting coronavirus.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Alibaba Cloud and Baidu are offering a powerful weapon to life-science researchers working to stop the spread of the illness officially known as Covid-19: <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3048317/alibaba-and-baidu-offer-ai-gene-sequencing-tools-help-fight-china?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">free access</a> to their computing horsepower and tools.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The companies have a variety of resources to support tasks like gene sequencing, protein screening, and drug development.</p><ul><li>Alibaba Cloud is providing access to its computing network as well as AI-driven drug discovery tools, datasets from earlier efforts to find drugs to combat SARS and MERS, and libraries of compounds.

WeiRan Yan of Sichuan University, with researchers from Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding and Sichuan Academy of Giant Panda, developed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11333?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">CGANet</a>, a speech recognition network that flags consummated unions based on panda vocalizations.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Prior work discovered the relationship between panda calls and mating success.
