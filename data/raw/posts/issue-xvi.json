New research lets computers imitate human voices across a number of languages.<br><br><strong>What’s new: </strong>Researchers at Google built a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04448.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">multilingual text-to-speech engine</a> that can mimic a person’s voice in English, Spanish, and Mandarin. You can hear examples of its output <a href=\"https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/multilingual/index.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">here</a>.<br><br><strong>Key Insights:</strong> Some languages are written as letters (like English) and others as symbols (Mandarin). The difference can have a dramatic impact on choice of architecture and training. Yu Zhang and colleagues found that processing phonemes — the basic sounds that make up language — simplifies the task by eliminating the need to learn pronunciation rules that vary among languages. <br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The model embeds phonemes in a vector space before decoding those vectors into spectrograms for a WaveNet speech synthesizer. Using phonemes enables the model to find similarities in speech among different languages, so the system requires less training data per language to achieve good results.</p><ul><li>The first step is to translate text input in various languages to phonemic spelling.</li><li>Phonemes are embedded in vector space using the architecture of the earlier <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05884.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Tacotron 2</a>, a state-of-the-art, single-language, speech-to-text model.</li><li>In the training data, an individual speaker and the words spoken are strongly correlated. To disentangle them, a separate speaker classifier is trained adversarially against Tacotron 2 to judge whether a particular phoneme embedding came from a particular speaker. Adversarial training allows phoneme embeddings to encode spoken sounds without information about a particular speaker such as vocal pitch or accent.</li><li>Separate models are trained to create two additional embeddings. A speaker embedding encodes an individual's vocal tone and manner. A language embedding encodes a given language's distinctive accents.</li><li>A decoder takes speaker, language, and phoneme embeddings to produce a spectrogram for the WaveNet synthesizer, which renders the final audio output.</li><li>By switching speaker and accent embeddings to a different set, the model can generate different voices and accents.</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>In a subjective assessment of naturalness, the multilingual model’s performance in three languages roughly matches Tacotron 2’s performance on one. <br><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Training a text-to-speech model typically requires plenty of well-pronounced and labeled training data, a rare commodity. The new approach takes advantage of plentiful data in popular languages to improve performance in less common tongues. That could extend the reach of popular services like Siri or Google Assistant (which work in 20 and 30 languages respectively out of 4,000 spoken worldwide) to a far wider swath of humanity.<br><br><strong>We're thinking: </strong>A universal voice translator — speak into the black box, and out comes your voice in any language — is a longstanding sci-fi dream. This research suggests that it may not be so far away from reality.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/09/d9062c1c-28ac-4325-8b18-88aa32ca51a7.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Meme about evaluation metrics\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"702\" height=\"395\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/d9062c1c-28ac-4325-8b18-88aa32ca51a7.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/09/d9062c1c-28ac-4325-8b18-88aa32ca51a7.jpg 702w\"></a></figure><p>How do you know if your new idea for improving your algorithm is better or worse than your old one?

But recent work shows that facial expressions actually provide scant information about a person’s feelings.<br><br><strong>What’s new</strong>: An in-depth <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/SAUES8UM69EN8TSMUGF9/full?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">review</a> of the scientific literature shows there are very few rules when it comes to how people use their faces to show emotion. For instance, the researchers found that a scowl indicates anger only 30 percent of the time.<br><br><strong>What they found:</strong> Psychologists from universities in the US and Europe spent two years poring over 1,000 studies, including their own, examining facial expressions of emotion. They identified three categories of shortcomings:</p><ul><li>Researchers don’t account adequately for variability in the emotions people intend to convey, and how others read them. The person making a face might be feeling something completely different from what an observer perceives, and vice versa.</li><li>Many studies assume there’s a consistent, species-wide map connecting certain sets of facial movements to emotional categories. If such a map exists, it contains many more side roads, dead ends, and detours than the literature describes.</li><li>Much research ignores cultural differences. A grin can be pleasant in one society but hostile in another. Also, context matters. A person scowling at a book might be angry at its message or just trying to decipher tricky wordplay.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Most emotion recognition systems are based on ’60s-era research by psychologist Paul Ekman. He argued that humans share a vocabulary of facial configurations tied to emotion.<br><br><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The emotion-detection industry is worth $20 billion, including marketing, security, and road safety, according to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8929793/emotion-recognition-analysis-ai-machine-learning-facial-expression-review?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><em>The Verge</em></a>. But there’s more than money at stake. Systems designed for security and safety may not be doing their job because they're based on faulty research. <br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Emotional expressions common to every human may exist. But if so, they’re more nuanced than current systems are designed to handle. Further research will help develop and validate AI's ability to recognize subtle muscle movements and contextual cues.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/09/45a761ca-0a57-4006-b530-141096024424--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Uncropped MRI frames for CINE, MAG, and VENC series in an oblique coronal view of the thorax\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1152\" height=\"646\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/45a761ca-0a57-4006-b530-141096024424--1-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/45a761ca-0a57-4006-b530-141096024424--1-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/09/45a761ca-0a57-4006-b530-141096024424--1-.png 1152w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h2 id=\"seeing-into-the-heart\">Seeing Into the Heart</h2><p>Machine learning stumbles in diagnosing many medical conditions based on imagery if little labeled data is available. In small data settings, supervised learning is often unable to train an accurate classifier. But a twist on such methods dramatically boosts accuracy — without additional hand-labeled data.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers at Stanford developed an improved <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11012-3?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">diagnostic model for bicuspid aortic valve</a>, a dangerous heart deformity, based on a database of MRI videos.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Medical data typically is aggregated from many doctors and clinics, leading to inconsistent labels. Jason Fries and his teammates sidestepped that problem via weakly supervised learning, an emerging approach that doesn’t rely on labeled data. The trick is to use a separate model to produce a preliminary label and confidence score for every training example.<br><br><strong>How it works: </strong>The labeler predicts initial diagnoses along with confidence levels, creating imprecise, or noisy, labels. A neural network uses the raw MRI and noisy labels to predict a final diagnosis.</p><ul><li>The labeler includes five algorithms that don’t learn. Rather, a data scientist sets them manually to compute the aorta’s area, perimeter length, resemblance to a circle, amount of blood flow, and ratio between area and perimeter. Using these values, each algorithm produces a prediction for every frame.</li><li>These features are mapped using a simple probabilistic model to a noisy label and a degree of confidence.</li><li>The noisy labels are used for training, with the loss function weighting higher-confidence labels more heavily.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The weakly-supervised diagnostic model diagnosed BAV correctly in 83 percent of patients. The previous fully-supervised method achieved only 30 percent.<br><br><strong>Why it matters: </strong>BAV is severely underdiagnosed (only one-sixth of sufferers had been labeled with the correct diagnosis in the training data set). Its day-to-day effects include fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Moreover, using long-term data on health outcomes, researchers discovered that patients whom their model diagnosed with BAV had twice the risk of a major cardiac event later in life. Having a correct diagnosis up-front clearly could be a life-saver.<br><br><strong>Takeaway:</strong> General practitioners aren’t likely to detect rare, hidden conditions as accurately as specialists. But patients don’t schedule appointments with specialists unless they get a GP’s referral. Models like this one could help solve that chicken-or-egg problem by bringing powerful diagnostic tools to common checkups.</p>","comment_id":"63321a34ac70f9003d76b6a4","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/09/946f0455-cc94-4b38-9a1b-98ec28574f78.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-09-26T14:31:32.000-07:00","updated_at":"2022-10-10T10:55:04.000-07:00","published_at":"2019-07-31T08:29:00.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"Shortly after Pi day (3/14), I announced our Pie & AI series of meetups.
