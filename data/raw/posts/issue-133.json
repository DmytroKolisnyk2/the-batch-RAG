For example, the United Nations has issued <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/03/1035381?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QwAkpWYd5cbmMTX5gb9_GYEBsWkI_vi0WyIti1i3vzXI7Qw0zTGiLe6VfcuW-v15PRAlZ\" rel=\"noopener\">guidance</a> that all decisions to take human life must involve human judgment.

Still, I’m concerned that such guidelines, while necessary, aren’t sufficient to prevent military abuses. User interfaces can be designed to lead people to accept an automated decision — consider the pervasive “will you accept all cookies from this website?” pop-ups that make it difficult to do anything else. An automated system may comply technically with the U.N. guidance, but if it provides little context and time for its human operator to authorize a kill mission, that person is likely to do so without the necessary oversight or judgment.</em></p><p><em>While it’s important to establish high-level principles, they must be implemented in a way that enables people to make fateful decisions — perhaps the most difficult decisions anyone can make — in a responsible way. I think of the protocols that govern the use of nuclear weapons, which so far have helped to avoid accidental nuclear war. The systems involved must be subject to review, auditing, and civilian oversight. A plan to use automated weapons could trigger protocols to ensure that the situation, legality, and schedule meet strict criteria, and that the people who are authorized to order such use are clearly identified and held accountable for their decisions.</em></p><p><em>War is tragic. Collectively we’ve invented wondrous technologies that also have unsettling implications for warfare. Even if the subject presents only a menu of unpalatable options, let’s play an active role in navigating the tough choices needed to foster democracy and civil liberties.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning,</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table class=\"hse-image-wrapper\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px !important;\"><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(59, 59, 59); word-break: break-word; text-align: center; padding: 5px 0px 10px; font-size: 0px;\"><img alt=\"ezgif.com-gif-maker (13)-1\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/5871640/hubfs/ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(13)-1.gif?upscale=true&amp;width=1200&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(13)-1.gif\" width=\"600\" align=\"middle\" class=\"stretch-on-mobile\" style=\"outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width: 100%; font-size: 16px;\"></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"high-energy-deep-learning\">High-Energy Deep Learning</h1><p>Nuclear fusion technology, long touted as an unlimited source of safe, clean energy, took a step toward reality with a machine learning algorithm that molds the fuel in a reactor’s core.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers at DeepMind and École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04301-9?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QwAkpWYd5cbmMTX5gb9_GYEBsWkI_vi0WyIti1i3vzXI7Qw0zTGiLe6VfcuW-v15PRAlZ\" rel=\"noopener\">developed</a> a reinforcement learning algorithm to manipulate hydrogen plasma — an extremely high-energy form of matter — into an optimal shape for energy production.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Reactors that confine plasma in a chamber known as a tokamak generate energy by pushing its atoms so close together that they fuse. A tokamak uses powerful magnetic coils to compress the plasma, heating it to the neighborhood of 100 million degrees Celsius to overcome the electrostatic force that normally pushes them apart. The authors trained a reinforcement learning model to control the voltage of 19 magnetic coils in a small, experimental tokamak reactor, enabling them to shape the plasma in ways that are consistent with maintaining an ongoing fusion reaction.</p><ul><li>The authors initially trained the algorithm in a simulated tokamak. Its reward function scored how well the plasma shape, position, and current matched the desired configuration.</li><li>The training harnessed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06920?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QwAkpWYd5cbmMTX5gb9_GYEBsWkI_vi0WyIti1i3vzXI7Qw0zTGiLe6VfcuW-v15PRAlZ\" rel=\"noopener\">maximum a priori policy optimization</a>, an actor-critic algorithm in which an actor learns to take actions that maximize rewards delivered by a critic. The actor, a vanilla neural network, learned how to control the simulated coils based on the current state of the plasma. The critic, a recurrent neural network, learned to predict the reward function’s score after each action.</li><li>At inference, the critic was discarded while the actor continued to choose actions 10,000 times per second.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> In experimental runs with the real-world reactor, a previous algorithm controlled the coils to form a preliminary plasma shape before handing off the task to the authors’ model. Plasma can't be observed directly, so the authors calculated its shape and position properties based on measurements of the magnetic field within the tokamak. In five separate experiments, the controller formed the plasma into distinct shapes, such as a conventional elongated shape and a prospective “snowflake” shape, within particular tolerances (2 centimeters root mean squared error for shape, 5 kiloamperes root mean squared error for current passing through the plasma). In a novel feat, the algorithm maintained two separate plasma droplets for 200 milliseconds.<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Conventional nuclear energy results from nuclear fission.

Should you fine-tune it to classify yes/no or to fill in missing words — both viable approaches that are likely to yield different results? New work offers a way to decide.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Yanan Zheng and collaborators at Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, Carnegie Mellon University, DeepMind, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Tsinghua University proposed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12742?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QwAkpWYd5cbmMTX5gb9_GYEBsWkI_vi0WyIti1i3vzXI7Qw0zTGiLe6VfcuW-v15PRAlZ\" rel=\"noopener\">FewNLU</a>, a method that compares fine-tuning algorithms in few-shot natural language understanding, or language comprehension tasks in which a model must learn from a few examples. They also provide a toolkit for optimizing fine-tuned performance.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Previous comparisons of fine-tuning algorithms used fixed hyperparameter values; the researchers chose values known to work with a particular algorithm and maintained them with other algorithms. But different combinations of algorithm and architecture require different hyperparameter values to achieve their optimal performance. So, to compare fine-tuning algorithms, it’s best to determine hyperparameter values separately for each combination.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors compared various data-split strategies and hyperparameter values for different fine-tuning algorithms applied to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03654?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QwAkpWYd5cbmMTX5gb9_GYEBsWkI_vi0WyIti1i3vzXI7Qw0zTGiLe6VfcuW-v15PRAlZ\" rel=\"noopener\">DeBERTa</a> and <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eA7AEtvS&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_QwAkpWYd5cbmMTX5gb9_GYEBsWkI_vi0WyIti1i3vzXI7Qw0zTGiLe6VfcuW-v15PRAlZ\" rel=\"noopener\">ALBERT</a>.

Changes in the prompt pattern led to the greatest standard deviation in performance across hyperparameters (average of 5.5 percent accuracy, compared to the next-highest, training order, at 2.0 percent), suggesting that it was the most important hyperparameter to optimize. Using Multi-Splits and the optimal hyperparameter values for each fine-tuning algorithm (specific to each model and task), PET, ADAPET, and P-tuning performed similarly and typically outperformed CLS by 15 to 20 percentage points in accuracy and F1 score. There was no clear winner among PET, ADAPET, and P-tuning, each of which achieved the highest accuracy or F1 score on one task or another, often within 1 standard deviation of each other.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It’s certainly good to know how to get the most out of fine-tuning. Beyond that, this work reinforces the notion that, since the only way to know the best hyperparameter values is to find them empirically, it pays to keep guessing to a minimum.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Here’s a puzzler: If the choice of a fine-tuning algorithm changes a model’s optimal hyperparameter values, is the choice itself a hyperparameter?</p>","comment_id":"6217d238644337003d956426","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-23-at-12.18.36-PM.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-02-24T10:45:12.000-08:00","updated_at":"2022-10-05T14:59:35.000-07:00","published_at":"2022-02-23T12:00:00.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"Russian troops have invaded Ukraine, and the terrifying prospect of a war in Europe weighs on my mind.
