In this letter, I would like to show why beating HLP isn’t always the best way to improve performance.</em></p><p><em>In many machine learning problems, labels are determined by a person who evaluates the same sort of input as a learning algorithm would. For instance, a human labeler may look at a picture of a phone to determine if it’s scratched, and an algorithm would examine a similar picture to learn to detect scratches. (Note that this is not always the case. A human labeling a cancer diagnosis on an X-ray image may also rely on a tissue biopsy from the patient, while an algorithm would use the resulting dataset to learn to diagnose cancer based on images alone.)</em></p><p><em>In cases where labels were determined by a human by looking at the same input that an algorithm would, what are we to make of situations in which HLP is well below 100 percent? This just means that different people labeled the data differently. For example, the ground-truth labeler who created a test set may have labeled a particular phone as scratched, while a different labeler thought the same phone was not scratched, and thus made a mistake in marking this example. If the second labeler disagreed with the ground-truth labeler on 1 out of 10 examples, then HLP in this task would be 90 percent.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen20Shot202020-11-1820at2012.51.1820PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Detecting system\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><em>In this situation, rather than trying to build a learning algorithm that achieves 91 percent accuracy, it would be better to look into how the two labelers formed their judgements and try to help them make their labels more consistent.</em></p><p><em>For example, all labelers may agree that scratches smaller than 1 mm are not significant (y=0), and scratches greater than 3 mm are significant (y=1), but they label scratches between 1 mm and 3 mm inconsistently. If we can spot this problem and get the labelers to agree on a consistent standard — say, that 1.5 mm is the point at which the labels should switch from y=0 to y=1 — then we’ll end up with less noisy labels.</em></p><p><em>Setting standards that make labels more consistent will actually raise HLP, because humans now agree with one another more frequently. At the same time, having more consistently labeled data will result in better machine learning performance. This improvement is more important in many practical applications than the academic question of whether an algorithm beat HLP.</em></p><p><em>HLP does have a role to play in establishing baseline performance for estimating irreducible, or Bayes, error, which in turn helps with error analysis. You can learn more about this in <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Deep Learning Specialization Course 3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Machine Learning Yearning</a>.</em></p><p><em>But the message I hope you’ll take away from this letter is that, when a human labeler has created the class labels that constitute ground truth and HLP is significantly less than 100 percent, we shouldn’t just set out to beat HLP. We should take the deficit in human performance as a sign that we should explore how to redefine the labels to reduce variability.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h2 id=\"news\"><strong>News</strong></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-gif-maker2033.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Collage of self portraits\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"unsupervised-prejudice\">Unsupervised Prejudice</h3><p>Social biases are <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200214105246.htm?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">well documented</a> in decisions made by supervised models trained on <a href=\"http://image-net.org/index?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ImageNet’</a>s labels.

In this way, they could determine the degree to which the model associated men versus women with those attributes.</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>Features generated by both models showed social biases such as associating white people with tools and black people weapons. While SimCLRv2 tended to associate stereotyped attributes with certain categories more strongly, iGPT showed such biases toward a broader range of categories. For instance, features generated by iGPT associated thin people with pleasantness and overweight people with unpleasantness, and also associated men with science and women with liberal arts.</p><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> ImageNet 2012 contains 14 million images annotated by human workers, who passed along their prejudices to the dataset. ImageNet creator Fei-Fei Li is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ai-biased-how-scientists-trying-fix/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">spearheading</a> an effort to purge the dataset of labels that associated genders, races, or other identities with stereotypes and slurs.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> When unsupervised models pick up on biases in a dataset, the issue runs deeper than problematic labels. The authors believe that their models learned social stereotypes because ImageNet predominantly includes images of people in stereotypical roles: men in offices, women in kitchens, and non-white people in general excluded from images showing situations that have positive associations such as weddings. Machine learning engineers need to be aware that a dataset’s curation alone can encode common social prejudices.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Datasets are built by humans, so it may be impossible to eliminate social biases from them completely. But minimizing them will pay dividends in applications that don’t discriminate unfairly against certain social groups.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-gif-maker2038.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Figures related to retailers' sales during the pandemic\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"retailers-adjust-to-the-pandemic\">Retailers Adjust to the Pandemic</h3><p>Covid-19 wreaked havoc with models that predict retail sales — but China’s biggest annual e-commerce event showed that they’re back in business.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> China’s two biggest retailers, Alibaba and JD, used AI models trained on pandemic-era consumer behavior to make sure warehouses were stocked and deliveries arrived on time during the annual Singles Day shopping bonanza, according to <em><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/13/1012073/pandemic-prepared-ai-for-alibaba-singles-day/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">MIT Technology Review</a></em>.
