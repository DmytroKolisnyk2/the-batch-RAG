Even though Meta’s violation was not AI specific, the EU’s response is a reminder that we need to build AI systems that preserve user privacy — not just to avoid fines but because we owe it to the people who are represented in the data.</em></p><p><em>Many companies that would benefit from machine learning can’t afford to hire enough skilled engineers. This creates a need for cloud-based AI software as a service (SaaS). How can customers of such services keep data private while counting on another party to process the data? Consider an AI system that reads electronic health records to make predictions about the patients. Can a hospital use a SaaS provider to monitor the system’s performance without exposing sensitive data?</em></p><p><em>Recently I learned about a monitoring technique that manages to keep data secure. While visiting Seattle, I met with Alessya Visnjic and Maria Karaivanova, two of the founders of <a href=\"http://whylabs.ai/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">WhyLabs</a>, which provides a SaaS platform that monitors machine learning applications. (Disclosure: WhyLabs is a portfolio company of AI Fund, which I lead.) They explained how they help customers monitor deployed systems for problems like <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/developing-ai-products-part-5-data-drift-concept-drift-and-other-maintenance-issues/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">data drift</a> — changes in the distribution of data because, say, a new disease emerged or the hospital started collecting data in a new way — while maintaining data privacy. In their approach, data never leaves the customer’s system. Instead, the SaaS provider (i) computes statistics on data at the source using efficient techniques based on Apache DataSketches and (ii) analyzes the statistics.</em></p><p><em>The system enables customers to set up dashboards that track the distribution of input features (in this case, body temperature, red blood cell count, and so on) and alerts them when the distribution shows anomalies. Software that runs on the hospital’s server collects data from multiple patients and transmits only the aggregate statistics to the cloud. In this way, the system can look for anomalies without receiving any individual’s data.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/ezgif-1-c7f58c9005-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Screen capture of WhyLabs functioning \" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/ezgif-1-c7f58c9005-1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/ezgif-1-c7f58c9005-1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/ezgif-1-c7f58c9005-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>This is useful for detecting not only data drift but also data-quality problems. Let's say the hospital shifts to a more precise body temperature notation and leaves the old temperature field empty. The system would monitor the fraction of missing temperature values across all patients and alert the hospital that this field is frequently empty. This enables monitoring of critical data-quality markers such as:</em></p><ul><li><em>missing value ratio</em></li><li><em>volume (that is, volume of data from different departments; a sudden drop in volume from one department may indicate a data pipeline issue in that department)</em></li><li><em>cardinality (detecting new values added to a categorical data field)</em></li><li><em>schema (which can catch changes in data types and formats, such as nine-digit postal codes entered into a field intended for five-digit postal codes)</em></li></ul><p><em>In the data-centric approach to building a machine learning system, our job isn’t done when we deploy a model. We still need to watch out for and address post-deployment issues. Too many teams don’t continuously monitor their models after deploying them because they’re concerned about complexity or privacy. This leads to outdated models that may perform poorly for weeks or months before the problem is detected.</em></p><p><em>In some tasks, complete privacy may not be possible when working with a SaaS provider, but WhyLabs’ approach (which includes <a href=\"https://github.com/whylabs/whylogs?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">open source tools</a>) preserves privacy while logging and monitoring. I hope we continue to invent techniques that enable AI systems to process data in the cloud while maximizing the degree of privacy we can offer to users and customers.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/HOKKIEN--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Image of body parts in Hokkien, map showing Hokkien speaking regions across the world and Model architecture of S2ST \" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/HOKKIEN--1-.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/HOKKIEN--1-.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/HOKKIEN--1-.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"translating-a-mostly-oral-language\">Translating a Mostly Oral Language</h1><p>Most speech-to-speech translation systems use text as an intermediate mode. So how do you build an automated translator for a language that has no standard written form? A new approach trained neural networks to translate a primarily oral language.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Peng-Jen Chen, Kevin Tran, Yilin Yang and teammates at Meta described a system that <a href=\"https://research.facebook.com/publications/hokkien-direct-speech-to-speech-translation/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">translates speech between English and Hokkien</a>, which is spoken by millions of people in east Asia.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Few people know how to translate between English and Hokkien, which makes it hard to assemble a dataset sufficient for training an English-Hokkien translation model. However, a fair number of people can translate between Mandarin and English and between Mandarin and Hokkien. By translating from English to Mandarin and from Mandarin to Hokkien, it’s possible to build a database of English-Hokkien speech pairs.</p><p><strong>The dataset:</strong> The authors collected a corpus of English, Mandarin, and Hokkien data. They employed human translators to translate the corpus. They used the translated corpus to synthesize further data.</p><ul><li>The initial corpus comprised (a) videos of Hokkein dramas with subtitles (5.8 hours of which were manually translated from Mandarin text into English text and speech), (b) an existing dataset of <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9295019?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">Hokkien speech</a> (manually translated into English text and 4.6 hours of English speech), and (c) an existing dataset of <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/N19-1202/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">English-to-Mandarin speech and text</a> (manually translated into 86 hours of Hokkien speech).</li><li>To synthesize additional English-to-Hokkien speech pairs, the authors used an <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04944?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">existing trained model</a> to translate <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7178964?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">English text with matching speech</a> into Mandarin text. Then, using the Hokkien dramas, they trained a text-to-speech transformer to translate Mandarin text to Hokkien speech. This process yielded 1,500 hours of corresponding English-Hokkien speech.</li><li>They used a similar process to synthesize additional Hokkein-to-English speech pairs (starting with the Hokkien dramas). This process yielded 8,000 hours of corresponding Hokkien-to-English speech.</li></ul><p><strong>The translators:</strong> Separate speech-to-speech systems with identical architectures translate from Hokkien to English and English to Hokkien, using Mandarin text as a stepping stone between the target languages.</p><ul><li>Given English or Hokkien speech, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08352?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">HuBERT encoders and HiFi-GAN decoders</a> learned to convert English and Hokkien speech to tokens and back.</li><li>Given English or Hokkien speech, separate <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">wav2vec 2.0</a> transformers learned to convert them into tokens.</li><li>Given English or Hokkein tokens, separate <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08210?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">mBART</a> decoders learned to turn them into Mandarin or English text respectively.</li><li>Given the resulting text, two transformer layers learned to translate it into Hokkien or English speech tokens.</li><li>At inference, the HiFi-GAN decoder converts those tokens into speech.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors compared their system to a baseline of their own design that translated directly between the spoken languages using an encoder-decoder. They evaluated the systems according to ASR-BLEU, which compares text overlap (higher is better) against reference text after translating speech to text. To render Hokkien speech as text for comparison, they developed a separate model that translated Hokkien speech into a phonetic script called Tâi-lô. Converting English to Hokkien, their system achieved 7.3 ASR-BLEU, whereas the baseline achieved 6 ASR-BLEU. Converting Hokkien to English, their system achieved 12.5 ASR-BLEU, whereas the baseline achieved 8.1 ASR-BLEU. Without the augmented data, both their system and the baseline scored worse by 6 ASR-BLEU to 9 ASR-BLEU.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Forty percent of the world’s languages have no standard written form, which means they’re left out of current translation systems.  This method provides a blueprint for machine translation of other primarily oral languages.</p><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Hokkien is spoken in several dialects, some of which are mutually unintelligible. So, while this system presumably serves most Hokkien speakers, it doesn’t serve all of them yet.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> The next step is to hook up the Hokkein-English model to existing translators for other languages. Is it good enough? ASR-BLEU scores in the 7-to-12 range are low compared to scores for, say, English-German, which are around 30. And, because translation errors compound from one language to the next, the more intermediate steps required to reach the target language, the lower the final translation quality. One way or another, we want to hear Hokkien speakers talking to everyone!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/BILLBOARDS-2_1200px--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Billboards displayed in different spaces and dashboard with data related to a billboard performance\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/BILLBOARDS-2_1200px--1-.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/BILLBOARDS-2_1200px--1-.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/BILLBOARDS-2_1200px--1-.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"billboards-are-watching\">Billboards Are Watching</h1><p>AI-driven signs are deciding what to display based on data harvested from passersby.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Companies that sell advertising in public spaces use face analysis and personal data to match ads with potential viewers in real time, civil-liberties watchdog Big Brother UK detailed in a new <a href=\"https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Streets-Are-Watching-You.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a>.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The report compiles applications and case studies drawn from product summaries and blog posts published by ad-tech companies.</p><ul><li>Quividi, a French maker of smart signs, offers a system that analyzes up to 100 faces at a time, identifying their gender, age, and mood along with the direction they’re facing and how long they look at the screen.

At inference, given a camera position and angle, it generates views of a scene by sampling points along virtual light rays that extend from the camera through each pixel. Given an embedding of a point’s position and the ray’s direction, separate fully connected networks compute its color and transparency. (Typically many points occupy empty space, so they’re fully transparent and have no color.) The system combines the color and transparency of points along the ray to find the associated pixel’s color.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Previous efforts to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11215?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">speed</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04618?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">up</a> NeRF training impose a 3D grid over the scene and learn an embedding of each grid point. When it comes to sampling coordinates along rays, these approaches interpolate embeddings of positions that fall in between the grid points. This process requires a lot of memory, and rendering is slow because ferrying data to the processor and back takes a lot of time. Limiting the total number of embeddings to fit within a processor’s cache eliminates this bottleneck, accelerating rendering. One way to do this is to hash the coordinates, which defines a function that maps them to the index of a list (hash table) of limited size. This makes it possible to map any number of points to a limited number of embeddings.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors trained separate systems of vanilla neural networks to generate 20 synthetic and real scenes used in the original NeRF paper. As in the original NeRF and its variants, the networks learned by minimizing the difference between the ground truth images and generated images from the same viewpoints. Given a camera position and viewing angle, the system projected a ray for each pixel in the resulting image and sampled from 3 to 26 points, depending on the scene’s size, along each ray.</p><ul><li>The system defined 16 3D grids with resolutions from coarse (16x16x16) to fine (512x512x512).</li><li>Given a point along a ray at a particular resolution, it located the positions of the eight corners of the cell closest to it and hashed the coordinates to retrieve the corresponding embeddings. Then it interpolated the embeddings to calculate a vector that represented the point.</li><li>It repeated this process at each resolution, producing 16 separate hash tables. Hashing each point’s coordinates at multiple resolutions kept the points differentiated by making it unlikely that different points would map to the same embedding (a phenomenon known as a hash collision) at all resolutions.</li><li>The system concatenated each point’s embeddings at every resolution and fed them to two vanilla neural networks. One network estimated opacity and the other estimated color.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors evaluated the system using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio</a> (PSNR), which measures image reconstruction quality (higher is better), and compared their results to the original <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">NeRF</a> and similar <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13415?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PqXVHhiJ-9qkPbLq6glHQHdaUrOFInmHQDL3qS0c1NMski6qQI55JeyctRgD0Z4LElbuW\" rel=\"noopener\">Mip-NeRF</a>.
