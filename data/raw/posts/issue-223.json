My message at both events is simple: Governments should not outlaw open source software or pass regulations that stifle open source development.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Regulating AI is a hot topic right now in the United States, European Union, and elsewhere.

We need good regulations to govern AI applications, but ill-advised proposals to regulate the technology would slow down AI development unnecessarily. While the EU’s AI Act thoughtfully addresses a number of AI applications — such as ones that sort job applications or predict crime — and assesses their risks and mandates mitigations, it imposes onerous reporting requirements on companies that develop foundation models, including organizations that aim to release open-source code.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>I wrote in an earlier&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/exaggerated-fear-of-ai-is-causing-real-harm/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GYd1KQfNzLpGrIsOK5zck8scpG09Zj2p-1gU3Bbh1G24Bx7s_nFRCKHrw0guODQk_ABjZ\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>letter</em></a><em>&nbsp;that some companies that would rather not compete with open-source, as well as some nonprofits and individuals, are exaggerating AI risks. This creates cover for legislators to pass regulations in the name of safety that will hamper open source. At WEF and APEC, I’ve had conversations about additional forces at play. Let me describe what I’m seeing.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>In the U.S., a faction is worried about the nation’s perceived adversaries using open source technology for military or economic advantage. This faction is willing to slow down availability of open source to deny adversaries’ access. I, too, would hate to see open source used to wage unjust wars. But the price of slowing down AI progress is too high. AI is a general-purpose technology, and its beneficial uses — similar to other general purpose technologies like electricity — far outstrip the nefarious ones. Slowing it down would be a loss for humanity.&nbsp;</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/unnamed--72--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Guest panel, including Andrew Ng, at the AI Governance Summit 2023 by the World Economic Forum\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/unnamed--72--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/unnamed--72--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/unnamed--72--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>When I speak with senior U.S. government officials, I sense that few think the possibility that AI will lead to human extinction is a realistic risk.

After all, the U.S. has a significant concentration of generative AI talent and technology. If we raise the barriers to open source and slow down the dissemination of AI software, it will only become harder for other nations to catch up. Thus, while some might argue that the U.S. should slow down dissemination of AI (an argument that I disagree with), that certainly would not be in the interest of most nations.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>I believe deeply that the world is better off with more intelligence, whether human intelligence or artificial intelligence.

Many teams that build applications based on large language models (LLMs) worry about their safety and security, and such worries are a significant barrier to shipping products.

New work found faster alternatives.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;Daniel J. Mankowitz and colleagues at Google developed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06004-9?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GYd1KQfNzLpGrIsOK5zck8scpG09Zj2p-1gU3Bbh1G24Bx7s_nFRCKHrw0guODQk_ABjZ\" rel=\"noopener\">AlphaDev</a>, a system that learned to generate algorithms that sort three to five numbers faster than previous state-of-the-art methods. Accelerating such algorithms can expedite the sorting of lists of any size —&nbsp;say, for search engines, ecommerce sites, and the like — since algorithms that sort more elements often call algorithms that sort fewer elements.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;Most programmers implement sorting algorithms in a high-level programming language like C++, which a compiler translates into Assembly Language instructions that control the processor and memory. A compiler can translate a single line of C++ into a variety of sequences of Assembly instructions that are equivalent functionally but vary in their speed (number of Assembly instructions required). A reinforcement learning agent can learn to choose a translation that maximizes speed.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;AlphaDev is a collection of neural networks that learn jointly via reinforcement learning. The authors initialized the system by giving it a sequence of unsorted numbers and an empty list of Assembly instructions. It built algorithms by adding Assembly instructions one by one. It earned rewards for choosing instructions that sorted the numbers correctly and quickly.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>With each new instruction selected, a transformer computed an embedding of the instructions so far, and a vanilla neural network computed an embedding of the order of the numbers after applying those instructions. The system concatenated the two embeddings to represent the current state.</li><li>Given the embeddings, two vanilla neural networks selected instructions. The first network (i) predicted the total future reward for the current state and (ii) calculated the probability that any given instruction would improve the algorithm. The second network (iii) predicted the reward after adding each possible instruction and (iv) predicted an embedding to represent the resulting state.</li><li>The system searched through possible sequences of instructions to find which instruction most often led to the highest predicted rewards. It added that instruction to the algorithm.</li><li>Once the system had built an algorithm, the authors&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reviews.llvm.org/D118029?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GYd1KQfNzLpGrIsOK5zck8scpG09Zj2p-1gU3Bbh1G24Bx7s_nFRCKHrw0guODQk_ABjZ\" rel=\"noopener\">uploaded</a>&nbsp;it to the main C++ library, which had not been updated in over a decade. The resulting algorithms now serve as open source subroutines in C++’s default sorting algorithm.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors tested two approaches to rewarding speed, minimizing either Assembly instructions or average runtime over a number of inputs. When AlphaDev minimized the number of Assembly instructions, it found an algorithm that sorted three integers using 17 instructions instead of the previous state-of-the-art algorithm, a human-engineered one that used 18 instructions. Its algorithm for sorting four integers used 28 instructions, equal to the typical one. Its algorithm for sorting five integers had 42 instructions, compared to the alternative’s 46 instructions. When AlphaDev optimized for runtime (running on Intel 6th-generation Core “Skylake” processor), sorting three integers took 2.18 nanoseconds, compared to the typical algorithm’s 4.86 nanoseconds. Sorting four unsigned integers took 1.96 nanoseconds instead of 5.43 nanoseconds and sorting five of them took 1.98 nanoseconds instead of 6.79 nanoseconds. AlphaDev achieved smaller speedups with longer number sequences: Sorting 16 unsigned integers took 9.5 nanoseconds instead of 10.5 nanoseconds, and sorting 262,144 numbers took 60.8 nanoseconds instead of 61.4 nanoseconds.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;This work repurposes the training method and architecture of game-playing models like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GYd1KQfNzLpGrIsOK5zck8scpG09Zj2p-1gU3Bbh1G24Bx7s_nFRCKHrw0guODQk_ABjZ\" rel=\"noopener\">AlphaZero</a>&nbsp;to solve real-world problems. The trick is to reframe the task of writing a sorting algorithm as a reinforcement learning problem.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;What other algorithms can this approach optimize?
