A new technique can improve a trained model’s performance on such underrepresented classes.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers at Jilin University, Megvii Inc., Beihang University, Huazhong University, and Tsinghua University led by Jialun Liu and Yifan Sun introduced a method that <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10826?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">synthesizes extracted features of underrepresented classes</a>.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> The researchers trained a model and then mapped the extracted features for each data class into a two-dimensional visualization. Classes with fewer samples covered a smaller volume, making nearby decision boundaries more sensitive to variations in the features. They reasoned that artificially increasing the volume of underrepresented classes to match that of other classes should result in more robust predictions on the underrepresented classes.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers used well represented classes to predict the distribution of features in classes with fewer samples.</p><ul><li>The researchers measured the distribution of features in a given class by locating the center of all training features in that class. The distribution’s shape is defined by the variance of angles between the center and the features themselves (the tan box in the animation above).</li><li>For each example of an underrepresented class, the researchers generated a cloud of artificial points so the cloud’s angular variance matched that of a well represented class (the yellow oval to the right of the dotted-line decision boundary above). They labeled the synthetic features as the undersampled class and added them to the extracted features.</li><li>The network learned from the artificial features using a loss function similar to the one called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07698?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">ArcFace</a>, which maximizes the distance between the center of extracted feature distributions and decision boundaries.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers extracted features from images using a ResNet-50. They applied those features to models built with the ArcFace loss and trained on two datasets pared down to create underrepresented classes of five examples each. Then they built models using their approach and compared the results. Their method increased the average precision (AP), a measure of true positive rate where 1 is perfect, from 0.811 AP to 0.832 AP on <a href=\"https://github.com/vana77/Market-1501_Attribute?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Market-1501</a>.

New work enables neural networks to connect the dots.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Ge Yang and Amy Zhang led researchers at Facebook, McGill University, and UC Berkeley to create <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03648?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Plan2Vec</a>, a method that helps reinforcement learning systems strategize by representing each observation of a given task as a point on a surface.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Reinforcement learning tasks generally involve reaching a goal as efficiently as possible. If a model can represent the task at hand as a weighted graph of points in space, then a conventional planning algorithm can find the shortest path between any two points. Plan2Vec observes solutions to a maze and distorts its representation so that points on a path out are closer together.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Training data for a reinforcement learning task consists of sequences of states and actions. The distance between any two states in general is not known, but the distances between states in a sequence are known.</p><ul><li>Plan2Vec first learns to distinguish whether or not states are neighbors using <a href=\"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/gutmann10a/gutmann10a.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">noise-contrastive estimation</a>. This method teaches the network to mark consecutive states in a sequence as close together and non-consecutive states as far apart.</li><li>From the predicted neighboring states, Plan2Vec extrapolates whether states from different sequences are neighbors, producing a graph that connects identified neighbors.</li><li>A planning algorithm uses the graph to generate a continuous surface that captures the predicted distances between all states.</li><li>To solve a task, Plan2Vec represents on the surface the starting and goal states. Then a planning algorithm finds the shortest path between them.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Plan2Vec completed a 2D maze 80 percent of the time compared with a variational autoencoder (VAE) approach’s 53 percent. It solved <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/streetlearn?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">StreetLearn</a>, which requires navigation based on scenes along a path rather than a map, 92 percent of the time, while the VAE was successful in 26 percent of attempts.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> VAEs are good at extracting low-dimensional features from images, but the meaning of those features may not be easy to interpret.
