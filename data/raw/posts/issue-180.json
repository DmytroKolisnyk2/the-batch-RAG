I think there’s a path for them to transform the way we access information, albeit one that poses technical and business hurdles.</em></p><p><em>What if, rather than searching the web, we could query an LLM and get an answer? We would receive not a page of web links but a piece of text that answered our query. This appears to work for basic factual questions, but for questions that require complex reasoning or specialized knowledge, today’s LLMs may confidently hallucinate an answer, making the result <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/large-language-models-like-chatgpt-need-a-way-to-express-different-degrees-of-confidence?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">misleading</a>.</em></p><p><em>Here’s one way to think about the problem. ChatGPT’s predecessor GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters. Using 16-bit, floating-point bytes, it would take around 350GB to store its parameters (many reports say 800GB). In comparison, Wikipedia occupies about 150GB (50GB for text, 100GB for images). While the comparison is far from apples to apples, the fact that an LLM has more memory than is needed to store Wikipedia suggests its potential to store knowledge.</em></p><p><em>But even Wikipedia contains a minuscule fraction of the knowledge available on the internet, which by some estimates amounts to 5 billion GB. Thus search, which can point us to pages from all corners of the web, can answer many questions that an LLM with fixed memory can't.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/unnamed--22--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Illustration of two red and blue toy robots fighting with a yellow background\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/unnamed--22--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/unnamed--22--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/01/unnamed--22--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>That said, I see significant potential in another technology, retrieval augmented generation. Rather than relying on a fixed LLM to deliver the answer to a query, if we first find relevant documents (online or elsewhere) and then use an LLM to process the query and the documents into an answer, this could provide an alternative to current web search. Executing this efficiently and at scale would be complex, but the effect would be akin to having an LLM do a web search and summarize the results. Examples of this approach include Meta's <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-small-language-models-can-perform-specialized-tasks/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Atlas</a> and DeepMind's <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/large-language-models-shrink/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">RETRO</a>.</em></p><p><em>While today's search engine giants are well positioned to execute on this technology, their businesses depend on users clicking on ads placed next to search results. If they were to deliver text that answered a query, where would ads fit into the picture? Google would need to solve that problem before it could replace traditional web search with LLMs. Search startups that don’t have as much to lose — or perhaps Microsoft’s Bing, which is the second most-popular search engine by some reckonings — may be more willing to embrace upheavals in the search-engine business model.</em></p><p><em>Of course, Google's business has many moats, or defenses. The company's control over the Chrome web browser and Android mobile operating system channels users to its search engine. Having a platform with many advertisers and a sophisticated ad system also enables Google to monetize user attention better than competitors. Thus, it can pay more for search traffic to, say, incentivize makers of web browsers to make it the default search engine.</em></p><p><em>It's fascinating that generative AI is already so powerful that Google declared an emergency.

They gave 33 the option to use <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/codex-apps/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_TbhZSuQAdoeT-2SQpXLG5eq1p4ut27i9UeiSvzj39x6Z1AZp43zLTtzzANiB8_3E5gNis\" rel=\"noopener\">Codex</a>, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3, through a custom user interface. The remaining 14 served didn’t receive automated assistance. Both groups were allowed to copy code from the web.</p><ul><li>The participants were given tasks including (1) write two Python functions that encrypt and decrypt a string respectively, (2) write a Python function that signs a message with a cryptographic key, (3) write a Python function that returns a File object for a given file path, and (4) write a Javascript function that manipulates an SQL table.</li><li>The authors also watched screen recordings to observe the participants’ behavior — for instance, copying code generated by Codex — and note the origins of programming errors.</li><li>After completing the tasks, participants rated their confidence in the correctness and security of their answers. The Codex group also rated their trust in the model’s ability to generate secure code for each task.</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>The authors evaluated the responses manually according to whether they were functional and secure. Participants who used Codex generally produced code that was less functional and secure, yet they expressed greater confidence in it. That said, the results varied with the task and programming language.</p><ul><li>Members who used Codex to produce nonfunctional code were more likely to rate their answers as more correct than members of the non-Codex group who produced correct code.</li><li>When coding in Python, participants in the non-Codex group were more than twice as likely to produce secure code.</li><li>Members of the Codex group who lacked prior digital-security experience were more likely to use unedited, generated code than those who had such experience (especially when coding in Javascript, a less-familiar language for many participants).</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news: </strong>Other research bolsters the notion that professional developers shouldn’t fear for their jobs quite yet. In a 2022 study, DeepMind’s <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/competitive-coder/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">AlphaCode</a> model competed in 10 simulated contests. The model correctly solved 34 percent of the validation questions and outpaced 46 percent of humans who had taken up the same challenges.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Generative coding tools are often regarded as a way for programmers to save time and automate basic tasks. But that efficiency may come at a price. Coders who use such tools would do well to pay extra attention to debugging and security.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>Code generation is an exciting development despite the questions raised by this study. We welcome further studies that compare programmers who use Codex, those who copy code from the internet, and those who use no outside assistance.
