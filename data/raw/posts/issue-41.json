They can build world models, too.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> A GAN generated a fully functional replica of the classic video game Pac-Man. Researchers from Nvidia, MIT, the University of Toronto, and Vector Institute developed <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/22/gamegan-research-pacman-anniversary/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">GameGAN</a> to celebrate the original Pac-Man’s 40th anniversary. The company plans to release the code in a few months.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> GameGAN learned to reproduce the game by watching it in action for 50,000 hours. During gameplay, the system synthesizes the action frame by frame using three neural networks.</p><ul><li>An LSTM-style network learned how user actions change the game’s state. For example, pressing the system’s joystick equivalent upward moves the Pac-Man character forward one space.</li><li>A network inspired by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">neural Turing machines</a> allows the system to store information about previously generated frames. In a maze game, retracing your steps should look familiar, and that would be difficult without memory.</li><li>Based on the memory, updated game state, and latest user action, GameGAN’s generator produces the next frame.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> While Nvidia is the first to use a generative adversarial network to reproduce a video game, other researchers have used machine learning for this purpose.</p><ul><li>An earlier model from Georgia Tech learns approximate representations of classic titles to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.02232.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">create</a> new games.</li><li>The <a href=\"http://metacreation.net/project/automatic-video-game-level-generation/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Metacreation Lab</a> at Simon Fraser University is working on models that generate new levels for existing games.</li><li>Researchers from Queen Mary University <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10520.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">trained</a> a neural network to duplicate a video game’s underlying mechanics by observing pixels.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Compared to the original arcade game, Pac-Man’s GAN-driven twin requires orders of magnitude <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z3evp8/nvidia-says-its-ai-created-a-fully-functional-version-of-pac-man?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">more computation</a> to run.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Autonomous systems such as self-driving cars and robots are often trained in elaborate simulators. Nvidia hopes that GAN-based sims can save time and money.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Fifty thousand hours is an awful lot of Pac-Man — or anything else! Simulation makes it possible to amass training data that would be virtually impossible to collect in the real world. It’s also a crutch that leads researchers to develop algorithms that work well in simulated environments but are hard to generalize to real-world conditions. Until better small-data algorithms emerge, GAN-based simulation looks like an exciting new direction.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Supercomputer2.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Animated drawing of hardware related to AI\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"horsepower-for-next-gen-networks\">Horsepower for Next-Gen Networks</h3><p>The for-profit research organization OpenAI has a new supercomputer to help achieve its dream of building the world’s most sophisticated AI.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Microsoft engineered the new hardware network to train immense models on thousands of images, texts, and videos simultaneously.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Hosted on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, the system comprises 10,000 GPUs and 285,000 CPUs.</p><ul><li>OpenAI has exclusive access to the new network.</li><li>The company <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">believes</a> that putting enormous computing power behind existing models could lead to artificial general Intelligence (AGI) capable of reasoning across a variety of domains.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> In 2019, Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/technology/open-ai-microsoft.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">invested</a> $1 billion in OpenAI in exchange for the first shot at commercializing the research outfit’s innovations.

Recent research tests the limits of conversational AI.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Daniel Adiwardana and collaborators at Google Brain propose a human-scored measure, Sensibleness and Specificity Average (SSA), to rate chatbots on important qualities of human dialog. They also offer <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09977v1.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Meena</a>, a chatbot optimized for open-domain, multi-turn conversation that scores well on the new metric.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Sensibleness (whether a statement makes logical and contextual sense) and specificity (how specific it is within the established context) are good indicators of performance in general conversation. While these criteria don’t lend themselves to gradient calculations, an existing loss function can serve as a proxy.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Meena is a sequence-to-sequence model with an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11117?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">evolved transformer</a> architecture. It comprises 2.6 billion parameters — a large number only a few months ago, lately overshadowed by ever larger models of up to <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">17 billion parameters</a>.</p><ul><li>The researchers trained the bot on 867 million (context, response) pairs gathered from social media conversations.</li><li>Provided a context, Meena learned to predict the actual response using perplexity, a measure of a language model’s predictive ability, as its loss function.</li><li>To avoid generating repetitive responses, the model builds multiple candidate responses and uses a classifier to select the best one. The researchers use a sample-and-rank approach to generate a fixed number of independent responses. A user-defined parameter controls the rarity of tokens selected.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers compared Meena, DialoGPT, Cleverbot, Mitsuku and XiaoIce. For each bot, they scored the SSA of both output transcripts and real-time conversational experiences. Meena showed considerably better performance, 79 percent versus the next-best score of 56 percent. The SSA scores of variously sized Meena implementations correlated with their scores on both human-likeness and perplexity.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> We’re all for better chatbots, and we’re especially charmed by Meena’s higher-education pun, “Horses go to Hayvard” (see animation above). But this work’s broader contribution is a way to compare chatbot performance and track improvements in conversational ability.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> SSA may not top every chatbot designer’s list of criteria. Google, with its mission to organize the world’s information, emphasizes sensibleness and specificity. But Facebook, whose business is built on friendly interactions that may be whimsical, emotional, or disjunct, is aiming for a different target (see “Big Bot Makes Small Talk” below).<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Even imperfect metrics — like the much-criticized but widely used <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DejHQYAGb7Q&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">BLEU score</a> for natural language processing — give researchers a clear target and accelerate progress.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1_AI4MC3BatchAd.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Machine learning can estimate the impact of medical treatment in individual patients.

In keeping with the company’s social-networking dominance, the bot is designed to excel at chitchat on any subject.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Led by Stephen Roller, Facebook researchers built <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13637?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Generative BST</a>, a transformer-based model comprising up to 9.4 billion parameters. They trained the bot on their own <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08449?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">BlendedSkillTalk</a> dataset of 5,000 conversations among 2,500 people who were instructed to be knowledgeable, empathetic, and generous with personal details.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> The keys to small talk are personality, knowledge, empathy, and balancing response length (too short shows lack of interest, too long betrays poor listening). BlendedSkillTalk is designed to teach the first three traits. Finding the right response length is a matter of generation strategy.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Many chatbots generate a set of potential responses and score the best one in a technique known as retrieval. In contrast, generative language models create responses one token at a time, often producing <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09751?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">dull or repetitive output</a>. Generative BST combines these approaches in a method called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04776?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">retrieve and refine</a>.</p><ul><li>The retriever network reads human dialogue turn by turn and learns to choose actual responses from responses sampled at random. The generator learns to re-create actual responses based on earlier turns.</li><li>The retriever predicts minimum response lengths to ensure that they’re conversationally appropriate and discourage repetitive output.</li><li>The generator uses beam search to generate a variety of related responses. It creates a set of initial tokens and then adds tokens one at a time based on the context generated so far.</li><li>At inference, Generative BST selects the most likely candidate based on the conversation to that point.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Human judges scored the performance of Generative BST and Google’s Meena (see “Toward Open-Domain Chatbots” above) according to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03087?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Acute-Eval</a>, a chatbot benchmark also developed by Facebook. Sixty-five percent of judges found Generative BST more human-like, while 75 percent found it more engaging. The researchers experimented with various techniques to build variants with different skills. For instance, 70 percent of judges found the version called BST Unlikelihood, which used a different generation approach, more human-like than Meena, but only 64 percent found it more engaging.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> The judges’ positive assessment of Generative BST’s human-like qualities relative to other chatbots doesn’t imply that any of them can carry on coherent conversations. You can read some nonsensical turns with Generative BST <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomerUllman/status/1259834838829465601?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">here</a>.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Generative BST held the record for chatbot parameter count for only a short time before Microsoft announced its 17 billion-parameter <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Turing-NLG</a>. But its malleable generator remains unique. Other researchers may be able to use this framework to create chatbots with particular qualities and behaviors.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Facebook’s bot takes Big Tech rivalry to a new level. The Googlers behind Meena reported a conversation (illustrated above) in which their system, considering education for barnyard animals, punned, “Horses go to Hayvard.” The Facebook authors tried out the joke on Generative BST.
