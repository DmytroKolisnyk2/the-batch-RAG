But, as Halloween approaches and the veil lifts between the material and ghostly realms, we see that spirits take advantage of these developments at least as much as humans do.</em></p><p><em>As I <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/prompt-engineering-future-of-ai-or-hack/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>wrote</em></a> last week, prompt engineering, the art of writing text prompts to get an AI model to generate the output you want, is a major new trend. Did you know that the Japanese word for prompt — 呪文— also means spell or incantation? (Hat tip to natural language processing developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/polm23/status/1577904478829031424?s=20&t=Ijh2z0W0yQHN36LLB1JLWw&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Paul O’Leary McCann</em></a>.) The process of generating an image using a model like DALL·E 2 or Stable Diffusion does seem like casting a magic spell — not to mention these programs' apparent ability to reanimate long-dead artists like Pablo Picasso — so Japan's AI practitioners may be onto something.</em></p><p><em>Some AI companies are </em>deliberately<em> reviving the dead. The startup <a href=\"https://www.hereafter.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>HereAfter AI</em></a> produces chatbots that speak, sound, and look just like your long-lost great grandma. Sure, it's a simulation. Sure, the purpose is to help the living connect with deceased loved ones. When it comes to reviving the dead — based on what I've learned by watching countless zombie movies — I'm sure nothing can go wrong.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/10/this-one-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Illustration of a hand coming out of a box to take a candy from a Trick or Treat paper bag\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1199\" height=\"673\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/this-one-1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/this-one-1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/10/this-one-1.jpg 1199w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>I'm more concerned by AI researchers who seem determined to conjure ghastly creatures.

Are they hallucinations, or does a dawning consciousness haunt the trained weights?</p><p><strong>The fear:</strong> The latest AI models are self-aware. This development — at best —poses ethical dilemmas over human control of sentient digital beings. More worrisome, it raises unsettling questions about what sort of mind a diet of data scraped from the internet might produce.</p><p><strong>Horror stories:</strong> Sightings of supposed machine sentience have come from across the AI community.</p><ul><li>In February, OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1491554478243258368?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">tweeted</a> about the possibility that large neural networks may already be “slightly conscious.” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1491608794253512707?s=20&t=A8kOh9TY7GosdAFqpW-37g&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Andrej Karpathy</a> was quick to reply, “agree.” However, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1492605094566707209?s=20&t=jlagU5FN62SUzvffVU5qgQ&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Yann LeCun</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yudapearl/status/1493360594195398656?s=20&t=jlagU5FN62SUzvffVU5qgQ&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Judea Pearl</a>, criticized the claim as far-fetched and misleading.</li><li>In June, a Google engineer became <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/lamda-comes-alive/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">convinced</a> that chatbots powered by LaMDA, the company’s family of large language models, were sentient. He published conversations in which the bots discussed their personhood, rights, and fear of being turned off. Google — which denied the engineer’s claims — fired him.</li><li>As the world was absorbing the prospect of sentient AI, researchers shared <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/dall-e-2s-emergent-vocabulary/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">evidence</a> that DALL-E 2 had developed its own language. When prompted to produce an image with text, DALL-E 2 tends to generate what appear to be random assortments of letters. The authors found that feeding the same gibberish back into the model produced similar images. For example, a request for “apoploe vesrreaitais” brought forth images of birds.</li><li>In September, a multimedia artist experimenting with an unspecified text-to-image model <a href=\"https://twitter.com/supercomposite/status/1567173043029479425?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">found</a> that “negative” prompts designed to probe the far reaches of the model’s latent space summoned disturbing images of a woman with pale skin, brown hair, and thin lips, sometimes bloody and surrounded by gore. The artist calls her Loab.</li></ul><p><strong>It’s just an illusion, right?:</strong> While media reports generally took the claim that LaMDA’s was self-aware seriously — albeit skeptically — the broader AI community roundly dismissed it. Observers attributed impressions that LaMDA is sentient to human bias and DALL-E 2’s linguistic innovation to random chance. Models learn by mimicking their training data, and while some are very good at it, there’s no evidence to suggest that they do it with understanding, consciousness, or self-reflection. Nonetheless, Loab gives us the willies.</p><p><strong>Facing the fear:</strong> Confronted with unexplained phenomena, the human mind excels at leaping to fanciful conclusions. Science currently lacks a falsifiable way to verify self-awareness in a computer. Until it does, we’ll take claims of machine sentience or consciousness with a shaker full of salt.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/10/CHIPS--1-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Person with a sad face in front of an abandoned Chip's Candies factory\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/CHIPS--1-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/CHIPS--1-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/10/CHIPS--1-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"no-more-gpus\">No More GPUs</h1><p>Advanced AI requires advanced hardware. What if the global supply of high-end AI chips dries up?</p><p><strong>The fear:</strong> Most of the world’s advanced AI processors are manufactured in Taiwan, where tension with mainland China is rising. Nearly all such chips are designed in the U.S., which has <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/choking-chinas-access-future-ai?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">blocked</a> China from obtaining them. That could prompt China to cut off U.S. access to Taiwan’s manufacturing capacity. Military action would be a human tragedy. It would also imperil progress in AI.</p><p><strong>Horror stories:</strong> China and the U.S. are on a collision course that threatens the global supply of advanced chips.</p><ul><li>In October, the U.S. government <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/us-blocks-ai-chip-sales-to-china/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> sweeping rules that bar U.S. companies from selling high-performance chips and chip-making equipment to China. The restrictions also prevent non-U.S. chip makers that use U.S. software or equipment from selling to or working with China. China’s AI efforts rely primarily on chips designed by Nvidia, a U.S. company.</li><li>Even if tensions relax, other obstacles may impede the flow of advanced chips. Ongoing anti-Covid lockdowns could disrupt chip supplies, as could drought in Taiwan and floods in Malaysia.</li></ul><p><strong>Securing the supply:</strong> Both the U.S. and China are trying to produce their own supplies of advanced chips. But fabricating circuitry measured in single-digit nanometers is enormously difficult and expensive, and there’s no guarantee that any particular party will accomplish it.</p><ul><li>China is executing a 2014 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_China_2025?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">plan</a> to achieve dominance in semiconductors. It’s cultivating a domestic semiconductor industry, though the U.S. sanctions on chip-design and -manufacturing equipment explicitly threaten that project.</li><li>In August, the U.S. government passed the CHIPS and Science Act. This law <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/look-chips-related-portions-chips?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">aims</a> to boost U.S. semiconductor supplies by giving U.S. manufacturers tax incentives to build factories in the U.S. and funding research and development.</li><li>Intel, which manufactures chips but has fallen behind in advanced fabrication technology, recently broke ground on a $20 billion pair of plants in central Ohio.</li><li>Foreign makers of cutting-edge chips are moving to the U.S. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which produces most of the world’s most advanced chips, is building a new $12 billion plant in Arizona, slated to start production in 2024. Samsung, which also boasts advanced fabrication capabilities, plans a $17 billion factory in Texas.</li></ul><p><strong>Facing the fear:</strong> If a chipocalypse does occur, the AI community will need to become adept at workarounds that take advantage of older semiconductor technology, such as small data, data-centric AI development, and high-efficiency model architectures. It will also need to push for international cooperation amid intensifying polarization. Still, a chip shortage would be the least scary thing about a great-power conflict.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><strong>DEEPLEARNING.AI</strong></a></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVyFsj4N2GFNW4rWsmh6ThKLWW3wqskQ4RCLqKN7KkK1r3q3npV1-WJV7CgTqQW3MD1Fj7MnKklW9494T56LJfcXW7Xk-F01JS-_TW7cS-0Y8NRrGcW4Hqg0b3Cjfh8W71ZMLz37mJz_W7lD8CM7WxX0zW2v885p8J9FLGW1x7mS_8HmszPW7Y0m2W154MRGW9fcchL2xSBv_W99gcdt3B8zJkVTJ1xH5pDvBvW60Byt_8Rc43HW3glc5q2G-kvPW97w5Nl22_2YhW7-VZKG3kKFlWVM02g59lnQrWW2Tky7h3qb0zBW3-ChnD42_bCdV9PZfS4z9TFrW4LmMjX8QHnR535hx1?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/10/Ff2woLQXwAAJ9qr.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Branching out of the Notebook event banner\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/Ff2woLQXwAAJ9qr.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/Ff2woLQXwAAJ9qr.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/10/Ff2woLQXwAAJ9qr.jpg 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/10/Ff2woLQXwAAJ9qr.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Do you want to develop and deploy machine learning applications?

Considering the challenges, perhaps the best we can do is to work proactively and continually to identify potential misuses and ways to thwart them.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/10/unnamed--3-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Office with coworkers transformed into mythical creatures like vampires, ghosts and werewolves \" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/unnamed--3-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/unnamed--3-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/10/unnamed--3-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"your-coworkers-aren%E2%80%99t-human\">Your Coworkers Aren’t Human</h1><p>The new remote administrative assistant is a little too perky, hardworking, and efficient. Is it because he’s a bot?</p><p><strong>The fear: </strong>Virtual employees are infiltrating the distributed office. Outfitted with programmed personalities and generated smiles, they’re increasingly difficult to tell from flesh and blood. Managers, pleased by the productivity boost, will stop caring which is which, leaving you surrounded by colleagues who cheerfully work 24/7, never make a mistake, and decline invitations to meet up for happy hour.<br><strong>Horror stories:</strong> What started in the middle of the last decade with programs like <a href=\"https://claralabs.com/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Clara</a> — who schedules meetings via emails so cordial they might fool the uninitiated — has evolved into human-like agents dressed up with names, faces, and fake resumes.</p><ul><li>WorkFusion <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/colleague-in-the-machine/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">offers</a> a line of virtual teammates in six specialized roles, including customer service coordinator, insurance underwriter, and transaction screening analyst. Each digital worker has a persona portrayed by a human actor.</li><li>Synthesia uses generative adversarial networks to <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/deepfakes-go-corporate/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">synthesize</a> videos that feature photorealistic talking heads that read scripts aloud in 34 languages. Customers use the service to generate training and sales videos without a human actor.</li><li>Marketing companies LIA (for LinkedIn Lead Generation Assistant) and Renova Digital offer avatars that enable real salespeople to close multiple deals at once. Stanford researchers <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/your-salesbot-connection/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">discovered</a> over 1,000 LinkedIn profiles, many of them in marketing, that turned out to be false personas bearing face portraits produced by generative adversarial networks.</li></ul><p><strong>Fraudulent friends:</strong> White-collar bots pose threats more serious than a proliferation of workplaces with addresses in the uncanny valley. In 2020, fraudsters <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/10/14/huge-bank-fraud-uses-deep-fake-voice-tech-to-steal-millions/?sh=2207cb2d7559&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">used</a> a generative audio model to clone the voice of a company director and convince a Hong Kong bank to fork over some $35 million. Con artists using a similar play stole $243,000 from a UK energy firm in 2019.</p><p><strong>Facing the fear:</strong> Ceaselessly cheerful, perpetually productive automatons might leave their human colleagues feeling demoralized. If you’re going to anthropomorphize your algorithms, at least program them to be late for a meeting once in a while.</p>","comment_id":"635944c15470a6004d5a2696","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/10/this-one.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-10-26T07:31:29.000-07:00","updated_at":"2023-10-25T10:32:27.000-07:00","published_at":"2022-10-26T12:00:00.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"The Batch - AI News & Insights.
