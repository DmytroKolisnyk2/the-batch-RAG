Indeed, even the cornerstone dataset for computer vision research, ImageNet, was built using images taken from the public internet. With the rise of data-centric AI, access to good data continues to grow in importance to developers.</em><br><br><em>What are the limits for scraping and using public data? Earlier this year, a United States court <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/18/web-scraping-legal-court/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">ruled</a> that scraping data from websites that don’t take measures to hide it from public view doesn’t violate a law designed to thwart hackers. I believe this is a positive step for AI as well as competition on the internet, and I hope it will lead to further clarity about what is and isn’t allowed.</em><br><br><em>Many companies aim to create so-called walled gardens in which they provide exclusive access to content — even though it may be visible to all — such as social media posts or user résumés (the data at the heart of the ruling). But such data is valuable to other companies as well. For example, while LinkedIn helps users display their résumés to professional contacts, other companies might use this data to recruit potential employees, predict whether employees are likely to leave their current positions (updating a résumé is a sign), or find sales leads. Scraping the web was important in the early days of the internet to make web search viable, but as new uses come up — such as using machine learning to generate novel insights — clear rules about which data can and can’t be used, and how, become even more important.</em><br><br><em>This isn’t a simple matter. There is a fine line between protecting copyright, which incentivizes businesses to create that data, and making data widely available, which enables others to derive value from it. In addition, freely available data can be abused. For example, some face recognition companies have been especially aggressive in <a href=\"https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/steal-your-face/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">scraping face portraits</a>, building systems that invade privacy.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/07/Data-Scraping2-tweak_1200px-1.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"data scrapping tweak\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/Data-Scraping2-tweak_1200px-1.webp 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/Data-Scraping2-tweak_1200px-1.webp 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/07/Data-Scraping2-tweak_1200px-1.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>The U.S. court found that scraping data that is publicly accessible doesn’t violate the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/4718?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a>. This is not the same as allowing unfettered access to web scrapers. Data held behind a login wall or accessible only after agreeing to restrictive terms of service may be a different matter. (Disclaimer: Please don’t construe anything I say as legal advice.)</em><br><br><em>While this ruling may hurt companies that have built businesses on data that is fully visible to the public, overall I view it as a positive step. It will increase the free flow of information and make it easier for teams to innovate in AI and beyond. Also, knocking down part of the wall that surrounds walled gardens should increase competition on the internet. On the other hand, it increases the incentives to put data behind a login wall, where it’s no longer publicly accessible.</em><br><br><em>The issues of open versus closed data aren’t new. With the rise of mobile apps over a decade ago, web search companies worried that data would be locked within mobile apps rather than accessible on the web. This is one reason why Google invested in the Android mobile operating system as a counterweight to Apple’s iOS. Although ideas about which data should be accessible continue to shift, I continue to believe that a more open internet will benefit more people. With the rise of AI, algorithms — in addition to people — are hungry to see this data, making it even more important to ensure relatively free access.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/07/MILITARY_600px_3.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"AI in the military\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/07/MILITARY_600px_3.webp 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"ai-war-chest-grows\">AI War Chest Grows</h1><p>Western nations are making a substantial investment in AI.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which includes the United States, Canada, and much of Europe, <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_197494.htm?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">announced</a> a €1 billion venture capital fund that will focus on technologies including AI.

Surprisingly, pretraining the vision model on images of humans performing manual tasks not only results in better representations but also reduces the cost of adapting the system to new tasks. Instead of retraining the whole system on images of a new task, object, or environment, the controller alone can be fine-tuned.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors pretrained a visual model to reproduce images that had been partly masked by obscuring a rectangular portion at random. The pretraining set was drawn from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00343?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EOm1d3kC_SFPUH7mhgXpGX7WuSvgIJFdj43EHpj8Bcc89B70rO-fg77VV5gF_cIgtEWkk\" rel=\"noopener\">three</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06669?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EOm1d3kC_SFPUH7mhgXpGX7WuSvgIJFdj43EHpj8Bcc89B70rO-fg77VV5gF_cIgtEWkk\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04261?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EOm1d3kC_SFPUH7mhgXpGX7WuSvgIJFdj43EHpj8Bcc89B70rO-fg77VV5gF_cIgtEWkk\" rel=\"noopener\">datasets</a> that include clips of humans performing manual actions such as manipulating a Rubik’s Cube. They used the resulting representations to fine-tune controllers that moved a robot arm in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10470?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EOm1d3kC_SFPUH7mhgXpGX7WuSvgIJFdj43EHpj8Bcc89B70rO-fg77VV5gF_cIgtEWkk\" rel=\"noopener\">simulation</a>. They fine-tuned a separate controller for each of four tasks (opening a cabinet door as well as reaching, picking up, and relocating objects of different colors, shapes, and sizes) for each of two types of arm (one with a gripper, the other with four fingers).</p><ul><li>The authors pretrained the vision transformer — a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EOm1d3kC_SFPUH7mhgXpGX7WuSvgIJFdj43EHpj8Bcc89B70rO-fg77VV5gF_cIgtEWkk\" rel=\"noopener\">masked autoencoder</a>  — to reconstruct video frames that were masked by as much as 75 percent.</li><li>They passed representations from the transformer, along with the positions and angles of the robot arm joints, to the controllers. They used PPO to train the controllers to move the arms.</li><li>Each controller used a different reward depending on the task. Reward functions varied depending on factors such as the distance between the robot hand or the object it was manipulating and a goal location.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> In all eight tasks, the authors’ approach outperformed two <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04136?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EOm1d3kC_SFPUH7mhgXpGX7WuSvgIJFdj43EHpj8Bcc89B70rO-fg77VV5gF_cIgtEWkk\" rel=\"noopener\">state-of-the-art</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14990?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EOm1d3kC_SFPUH7mhgXpGX7WuSvgIJFdj43EHpj8Bcc89B70rO-fg77VV5gF_cIgtEWkk\" rel=\"noopener\">methods</a> that train the visual and controller models on images of robots for training. The authors compared their representations to those produced by a transformer trained on ImageNet in supervised fashion. In seven tasks, the controller that used their representations outperformed one that used the supervised transformer’s representations. In the eighth, it performed equally well. In tasks that required a four-fingered arm to pick up an object, the authors’ approach achieved a success rate of 80 percent versus 60 percent.</p><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> The authors didn’t compare masked pretraining on images of humans with masked pretraining on images of robots. Thus, it’s not clear whether their method outperformed the baseline due to their choice of training dataset or pretraining technique.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Learning from more varied data is a widely used approach to gaining skills that generalize across tasks. Masked pretraining of visual models has improved performance in <a href=\"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Wang_BEVT_BERT_Pretraining_of_Video_Transformers_CVPR_2022_paper.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EOm1d3kC_SFPUH7mhgXpGX7WuSvgIJFdj43EHpj8Bcc89B70rO-fg77VV5gF_cIgtEWkk\" rel=\"noopener\">video classification</a>, <a href=\"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Chang_MaskGIT_Masked_Generative_Image_Transformer_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EOm1d3kC_SFPUH7mhgXpGX7WuSvgIJFdj43EHpj8Bcc89B70rO-fg77VV5gF_cIgtEWkk\" rel=\"noopener\">image generation</a>, and other tasks. The combination looks like a winner.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Variety of data is important, but so is its relation to the task at hand. ImageNet probably is more varied than the authors’ training set of humans performing manual actions, but it’s unrelated to tasks performed by robot arms. So it stands to reason that the authors’ dataset was more effective.</p>","comment_id":"62e2d916849958003d798e7e","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/07/Data-Scraping2-tweak_1200px-1.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-07-28T11:44:38.000-07:00","updated_at":"2022-10-05T14:31:43.000-07:00","published_at":"2022-07-27T12:00:00.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"In
