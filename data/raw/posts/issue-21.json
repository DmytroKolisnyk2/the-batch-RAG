Researchers replaced a slew of biased labels and are working on further upgrades, according to <em><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ai-biased-how-scientists-trying-fix/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Wired</a></em>. (To be clear, the ImageNet Challenge training set is a subset of 1.2 million images and 1,000 classes.)<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Scientists at Princeton and Stanford, including Fei-Fei Li, who built the first version of ImageNet a decade ago, are <a href=\"http://image-net.org/update-sep-17-2019?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">updating</a> both the dataset and its website.</p><ul><li>ImageNet’s labels were based on WordNet, a 1980s-era database of word relations. ImageNet’s compilers took WordNet as it was, despite changes in social standards since it was compiled. To weed out slurs and other offensive labels, the Princeton-Stanford team combed through the 2,832 descriptions in ImageNet’s &lt;person&gt; category. They cut nearly 60 percent of &lt;person&gt; labels.</li><li>ImageNet’s original army of freelance labelers also often tagged photos with subjective labels. A person standing in a doorway, for instance, might be labelled <em>host</em>. To clean up the data, the Princeton-Stanford researchers rated words on how easy they were to visualize. They removed low-scoring words in the &lt;person&gt; subtree, eliminating nearly 90 percent of the remaining labels.</li><li>The researchers are working to address general lack of diversity in ImageNet labels. First, they labeled people featured in ImageNet according to perceived sex, skin color, and age. Correlating these demographic identifiers with image labels like <em>programmer</em> or <em>nurse</em>, the researchers found the labels were badly skewed toward particular groups. They propose automatically balancing the diversity of images in each category. The number of images tagged both <em>female</em> and <em>nurse</em>, for instance, would be reduced until it matched those tagged <em>male</em> and <em>nurse</em>.</li><li>A website update will add a button to report offensive images or labels. The researchers are developing a protocol for responding to reported issues.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Late last year, a web app called <a href=\"https://www.excavating.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">ImageNet Roulette</a> briefly enabled the public to experience the dataset’s biases firsthand. Users could upload images, and an ImageNet-trained model would classify any faces. The app went viral after users posted on social media selfies tagging them as criminals or racial and gender stereotypes.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> ImageNet can be used to pretrain vision models for sensitive applications like vetting job applicants and fighting crime. It is well established that biases in training data can be amplified when a model encounters real-world conditions.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Bias in AI has been widely discussed for years. It’s surprising that these issues in ImageNet only now are becoming widely recognized —a sign that greater education in bias should be a priority for the AI community. If such biases exist even in ImageNet, they surely exist in many more datasets.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SHA-RNN20ASPECT.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Single Headed Attention RNN (SHA-RNN)\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"language-modeling-on-one-gpu\">Language Modeling on One GPU</h2><p>The latest large, pretrained language models rely on trendy layers based on transformer networks. New research shows that these newfangled layers may not be necessary.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Networks such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">BERT</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09223?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">ERNIE</a> take advantage of multi-headed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">attention</a> layers to outcompete LSTM language models. But training these layers requires lots of compute on enormous GPU clusters. Stephen Merity of d⁄dx Times Labs struck a blow for garage AI with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11423?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Single Headed Attention RNN</a> (SHA-RNN), which nearly matched state-of-the-art performance after training on a single GPU for less than 24 hours. As he puts it in a tartly worded paper, “Take that, Sesame Street.”<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> The author set out to find a high-performance language model suitable for his personal computer. He used a single attention head out of skepticism that multiple heads are worth their computational cost. Simplifying the transformer’s feed-forward network enabled him to run the model on a single GPU.<br><strong><br>How it works:</strong> SHA-RNN is built on an LSTM to represent more explicitly the sequential nature of text.</p><ul><li>The model reads an input text sequence token by token and predicts the next token, usually a word or root of a word. The LSTM’s memory component stores important learned features.</li><li>The LSTM’s output layer feeds the single-headed attention layer, which models relationships between tokens across the sequence.</li><li>The attention layer’s output feeds a so-called boom layer. This layer replaces the transformer’s usual two feed-forward layers with a single feed-forward layer plus a summing layer to maintain vector length.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Merity tested SHA-RNN by compressing the enwik8 dataset. More accurate language models use fewer bits to represent a sequence because they know, to some extent, which words will occur. SHA-RNN achieved 1.068 bits per character compared to 0.99 by Sparse Transformer — slightly less accurate, but in half as many parameters.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> An LSTM is a good choice for sequential language-prediction tasks like enwik8. In non-sequential tasks such as fill-in-the-blanks, multi-headed attention is a better choice. A version of Transformer-XL that has even fewer parameters than SHA-RNN performed better on the compression task.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> SHA-RNN isn’t an out-and-out replacement for transformer-based networks. But it shows that LSTMs remain relevant and useful in language modeling. And if you’re looking for a way to get people to read your research, the author’s style offers pointers: This paper is a very entertaining read!<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Researchers like to focus on optimizing state-of-the-art methods, and media hype frequently chases the latest leaderboard topper. Yet foundational algorithms remain valuable in a variety of contexts.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Facebook20Deepfakes.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"AI-generated face\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"facebook-vs-deepfakes\">Facebook vs Deepfakes</h2><p>Facebook announced a ban on deepfake videos, on the heels of a crackdown on counterfeit profiles that used AI-generated faces.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Facebook <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/01/enforcing-against-manipulated-media/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">declared</a> this week that it will remove deepfake videos it deems deliberately misleading.

A new system surpassed human accuracy in trials, but critics aren’t convinced.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> A computer vision model for diagnosing breast cancer outperformed radiologists in the U.S. and UK, according to a study published in <em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1799-6.epdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Nature</a></em>. The announcement, however, met with skepticism from some experts. <br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Researchers at Google Health, DeepMind, and other organizations trained a model on 76,000 X-ray images from one U.S. clinic and 30,000 from two UK screening centers. Each image came with data from a follow up visit at least a year later, when doctors either confirmed or ruled out a tumor. The researchers graded the model’s accuracy against average diagnostic accuracy in each country’s health care system.</p><ul><li>A single radiologist had checked U.S. mammograms. Compared with the radiologist, the model produced 9.4 percent fewer false negatives and 5.7 percent fewer false positives.</li><li>In the UK, two human radiologists typically screened each mammogram. Compared to that more rigorous system, the model produced 2.7 percent fewer false negatives and 1.2 fewer false positives.</li><li>The researchers also recruited six U.S. radiologists to analyze 500 of the images. The model outperformed that panel, particularly with respect to more invasive cancers. But it also missed a tumor that all six radiologists found.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> The study <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danilobzdok/status/1212515512107843590?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">faced</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jugander/status/1212801973130420225?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">criticism</a> that the dataset, model, and procedural details were not available to researchers aiming to reproduce its results. Moreover, experts said the images used in the new study <a href=\"https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/01/06/google-ai?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">didn’t adequately represent</a> the at-risk population, according to the Advisory Board, a healthcare consultancy. Incidence of breast cancer in the sample dataset was higher than average, and the images weren’t annotated with the patients’ genetic heritage — which could skew the results, because some ethnic groups are at greater risk of developing tumors. <br> <br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Google’s study overshadowed earlier <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08297?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">results</a> from NYU, where researchers trained a similar model to detect cancer in mammograms. Their model scored highly on images that had been verified independently, and it matched the performance of a panel of 12 radiologists. The researchers also found that a hybrid model — which averaged a human radiologist’s decision with the model’s prediction — outperformed either one separately.<br><br><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Worldwide, breast cancer <a href=\"https://www.bcrf.org/breast-cancer-statistics-and-resources?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">accounts</a> for 12 percent of all cancer cases. The disease has been on the rise since 2008, with confirmed cases increasing by 20 percent and mortality by 14 percent.
