This time, let’s examine the further challenge of additional maintenance cost.</em><br><br><em>Some engineers think that when you deploy an AI system, you’re done. But when you first deploy, you may only be halfway to the goal. Substantial work lies ahead in monitoring and maintaining the system. Here are some reasons why:</em></p><ul><li><em><strong>Data drift.</strong> The model was trained on a certain distribution of inputs, but this distribution changes over time. For example, a model may have learned to estimate demand for electricity from historical data, but climate change is causing unprecedented changes to weather, so the model’s accuracy degrades.</em></li><li><em><strong>Concept drift.</strong> The model was trained to learn an </em>x<em>-&gt;</em>y<em> mapping, but the statistical relationship between </em>x<em> and </em>y<em> changes, so the same input </em>x<em> now demands a different prediction </em>y<em>. For example, a model that predicts housing prices based on square footage will lose accuracy as inflation causes prices to rise.</em></li><li><em><strong>Changing requirements.</strong> The model was built to perform a particular task, but the product team decides to modify its capabilities. For instance, a model detects construction workers who wander into a dangerous area without a hard hat for more than 5 seconds. But safety requirements change, and now it must flag hatless workers who enter the area for more than 3 seconds. (This issue sometimes manifests as concept drift, but I put it in a different category because it’s often driven by changes in the product specification rather than changes in the world.)</em></li></ul><p><em>Detecting concept and data drift is challenging, because AI systems have unclear boundary conditions. For traditional software, boundary conditions — the range of valid inputs — are usually easy to specify. But for AI software trained on a given data distribution, it’s challenging to recognize when the data distribution has changed sufficiently to compromise performance.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/DeepLearning-Cartoon_0728-2-copy.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Cartoon about data\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/DeepLearning-Cartoon_0728-2-copy.jpeg 600w\"></figure><p><em>This problem is exacerbated when one AI system’s output is used as another AI’s input in what’s known as a data cascade. For example, one system may detect people and a second may determine whether each person detected is wearing a hard hat. If the first system changes — say, you upgrade to a better person detector — the second may experience data drift, causing the whole system to degrade.</em><br><br><em>Even if we detect these issues, our tools for fixing them are immature. Over the past few decades, software engineers have developed relatively sophisticated tools for versioning, maintaining, and collaborating on code. We have processes and tools that can help you fix a bug in code that a teammate wrote 2 years ago. But AI systems require both code and data. If you need to fix a few training examples that a teammate collected and labeled 2 years ago, will you be able to find the documentation and the exact version of the data? Can you verify that your changes are sound and retrain the model on the revised dataset? Tools for data management, unlike tools for code management, are still nascent.</em><br><br><em>Beyond data maintenance, we still have traditional software maintenance to deal with. For instance, many teams had to upgrade from TensorFlow 1 to TensorFlow 2.</em><br><br><em>These problems will recede as data-centric AI tools and methodologies evolve. But for now, being aware of them and planning projects around them can help you build better models and reduce costs.</em><br><br><em>Keep learning!</em><br><br><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h2 id=\"news\">News</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/CITY--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"AI system monitoring urban traffic \" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/CITY--1-.gif 600w\"></figure><h2 id=\"meet-the-new-smart-cities-champ\">Meet the New Smart-Cities Champ</h2><p>Chinese researchers for the first time swept a competition to develop AI systems that monitor urban traffic.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Chinese universities and companies won first and second place in all five categories of the <a href=\"https://www.aicitychallenge.org/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">2021 AI City Challenge</a>, beating hundreds of competitors from 38 nations. U.S. teams dominated the competition in its first three years, but Chinese contestants started overtaking them last year.<br><br><strong>What happened:</strong> 305 teams entered at least one of the competition’s <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12233?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">five tracks</a>.

(Professional gamers have reaction times <a href=\"https://dotesports.com/general/news/how-to-increase-reaction-time-in-gaming?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">between 100 and 250 milliseconds</a>.)

Activision recently banned 60,000 players of Call of Duty: Warzone for using them. Typically, such cheats are add-ons to game software.

If different types of data share similar patterns, a transformer trained on one type can operate on another.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers started with a 36-layer <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">GPT-2 pretrained on WebText</a> (posts on the website Reddit).

Their approach performed nearly as well, sometimes better. For instance, on CIFAR-10, their approach achieved 72.1 percent accuracy versus the fully fine-tuned model’s 70.3 percent. On remote homology detection, their approach achieved 12.7 percent versus 9 percent. Language pre-training contributed to the improvement: For instance, on CIFAR-10, their model achieved 68.2 percent versus the randomized model’s 61.7 percent.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It appears that similar information structures — in the authors’ term, grammars — pervade the world.
