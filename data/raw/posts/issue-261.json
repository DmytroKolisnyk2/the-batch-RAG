I’m teaching this introductory course to help beginners take advantage of powerful trends that are reshaping computer programming. It’s designed for people in any field — be it marketing, finance, journalism, administration, or something else — who can be more productive and creative with a little coding knowledge, as well as those who aspire to become software developers. Two of the four courses are available now, and the remaining two will be released in September.&nbsp;</p><p>Generative AI is transforming coding in two ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Programs are using AI:&nbsp;</strong>Previously, you had to learn a lot about coding before it became useful. Now, knowing how to write code that calls large language models (and other AI APIs) makes it possible to build powerful programs more easily. This is increasing the value of coding.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>AI is helping programmers:&nbsp;</strong>Programmers are using large language models as coding companions that write pieces of code, explain coding concepts, find bugs, and the like. This is especially helpful for beginners, and it lowers the effort needed to learn to code.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The combination of these two factors means that novices can learn to do useful things with code far faster than they could have a year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>These courses teach coding in a way that is aligned with these trends: (i) We teach how to write code to use AI to carry out tasks, and (ii) Unlike some instructors who are still debating how to restrict the use of ChatGPT, we embrace generative AI as a coding companion and show how to use it to accelerate your learning.&nbsp;</p><p>To explain these two trends in detail:</p><p><strong>Programs are using AI.&nbsp;</strong>Because programs can now take advantage of AI, increasingly knowing a little bit about how to code helps people in roles other than software engineers do their work better. For example, I’ve seen a marketing professional write code to download web pages and use generative AI to derive insights; a reporter write code to flag important stories; and an investor automate first drafts of contracts. Even if your goal is not to become a professional developer, learning just a little coding can be incredibly useful!&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-python-for-beginners?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/08/AIP4B-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/AIP4B-1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/AIP4B-1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/08/AIP4B-1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>In the courses, you’ll use code to write personalized notes to friends, brainstorm recipes, manage to-do lists, and more.</p><p><strong>AI is helping programmers.</strong>&nbsp;There is a growing body of evidence that AI is making programming easier.

The European Union’s AI Act classifies AI in hiring as a high-risk application that requires special oversight and frequent audits for bias.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;When it comes to AI in recruiting and hiring, most attention – and money – has gone to employers. Yet the candidates they seek increasingly rely on AI to get their attention and seal the deal. A late 2023 LinkedIn survey&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/us-labor-market-showed-mixed-signals-linkedin-economic-graph-aiutc/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9XXzZk4EmtF-yjHJO38KMbwaD_ml1s8zIgYPsUL0YgRdrHQw3WELF_oIHxO_3aI6DsAT0w\" rel=\"noopener\">found</a>&nbsp;that U.S. and UK job seekers applied to 15 percent more jobs than a year earlier, a change many recruiters&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmylucas/2023/12/11/armed-with-ai-workers-are-applying-to-more-jobs-its-upping-the-competition/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9XXzZk4EmtF-yjHJO38KMbwaD_ml1s8zIgYPsUL0YgRdrHQw3WELF_oIHxO_3aI6DsAT0w\" rel=\"noopener\">attributed</a>&nbsp;to generative AI.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:&nbsp;</strong>AI is making employers and employees alike more efficient in carrying out the tasks involved in hiring. Misaligned incentives are leading to an automation arms race, yet both groups aim to find the right fit.
