There has been a lot of hype about generative AI’s ability to transform industries overnight. Certainly many industries — including education — will be transformed. But we’re about 15 years into the deep learning revolution, and we’re not yet done identifying and building useful deep learning applications. Despite the exciting progress to date with generative AI, I expect that a decade from now we will still be far from finished identifying and building generative AI applications for education and numerous other sectors.</p><p>This was the first time since 2019 that Coursera’s conference was held in person. It was great to see so many people dedicated to the educational mission coming together to discuss innovations, including generative AI innovations, that serve learners.</p><p>Coursera’s CEO Jeff Maggioncalda and the company’s executive team demonstrated multiple generative AI products, such as:</p><ul><li>Coursera Coach, a chatbot that understands the context of a learner's journey and answers their questions (without giving away exact answers to quiz questions!)</li><li>Course Builder, which businesses are using to customize long courses or specializations quickly, for example, by selecting the parts most relevant to their business</li><li>Coach for Interactive Instruction, which lets learners have a Socratic dialog and learn or practice new concepts in conversation</li></ul><p>Because AI is a general-purpose technology, there are many opportunities to apply it to different tasks in education. I was thrilled at the volume of experimentation happening across Coursera, DeepLearning.AI, and the broader ecosystem of partners and customers. I was also proud to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.coursera.org/announcing-courseras-2024-outstanding-partner-achievement-award-winners?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8owPS4RQXE1PMI9saQspV7lcQaeOlqrsRXJBfK8nUaBF_MsCXsS97s2L53ksI9cL8oBrCt\" rel=\"noopener\">present</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.coursera.org/introducing-courseras-2024-outstanding-achievement-award-winners-customers/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8owPS4RQXE1PMI9saQspV7lcQaeOlqrsRXJBfK8nUaBF_MsCXsS97s2L53ksI9cL8oBrCt\" rel=\"noopener\">awards</a>&nbsp;to many partners and customers who are doing great work to serve learners.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/09/unnamed--13--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Coursera Connect event in Las Vegas, September 2024, featuring Andrew Ng and Coursera executives during panel discussions and presentations.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/09/unnamed--13--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/09/unnamed--13--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/09/unnamed--13--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>I was particularly gratified by the number of people coming together in service of the education mission. Even before the recent rise of AI, education was already urgently in need of improvement. With AI transforming jobs, the need has become even more acute. My heart was warmed by the conversations I had with many people from universities, high schools, businesses, and the Coursera team who have a deep desire to help others through education.</p><p>Coursera held its first conference in 2013, when the online education movement was in its early days, and we all had high hopes for where it could go. Today, there are over 155 million learners on Coursera. Despite that, given society’s heightened need for education and AI’s potential to transform the field, I feel the opportunities for edtech at this moment are greater than at any moment over the past decade.</p><p>Keep learning!</p><p>Andrew</p><p>P.S.

The robot was controlled by a high-level controller: a custom algorithm including a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classified whether to return the ball using a forehand or backhand stroke and a vanilla neural network that classified spin. The high-level controller selected among 17 low-level controllers (all CNNs). Each low-level controller executed a different skill, enabling the system to return serves or rallies, adjust for ball spin, target different spots on the table, and so on.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The authors collected a dataset of ball positions from human-to-human play. Using the perception system, they derived the ball’s initial positions, velocities, and angular velocities. After training the system the first time, they collected similar data for human-robot play and trained their system further using those examples.&nbsp;</li><li>Training took place in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mujoco.org/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--c0nG4TrrE_gYiMOvohUdxm_ANhEP0mYcqOgXNWmXHOWcndvgdoLpuW6EwUysfUV6JX5kw\" rel=\"noopener\">simulation</a>&nbsp;(except the high-level controller’s vanilla neural network, which learned to classify spin via supervision).The high-level controller’s CNN learned to choose forehand or backhand to maximize the rate at which the robot successfully returned the ball. The low-level controllers learned using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06572?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--c0nG4TrrE_gYiMOvohUdxm_ANhEP0mYcqOgXNWmXHOWcndvgdoLpuW6EwUysfUV6JX5kw\" rel=\"noopener\">blackbox gradient sensing</a>, an evolutionary algorithm, based on several rewards, such as rewarding the controller if it successfully returned the ball and punishing it if the robot collided with itself or the table.&nbsp;</li><li>Each time the opponent hit the ball, the high-level controller decided which low-level controller to use. The decision was based on factors such as whether the ball had topspin or underspin and estimated statistics such as return rate, opponent’s paddle velocity, and estimated position where the ball would land on the opponent’s side.</li><li>Given the last 0.14 seconds of the ball’s position and velocity, as well as the robot’s joint positions and its position on the gantries, the selected low-level controller determined how fast to move the robot to return the ball.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:&nbsp;</strong>The robot played 29 three-game matches against 29 players of varying skill (beginner, intermediate, advanced, and advanced+ as rated by a professional coach).</p><ul><li>It won all 7 (100 percent) of its matches against beginners, 6 (55 percent) of its matches against intermediate players, and zero matches against advanced or advanced+ players.</li><li>On a point-by-point basis, it won 72 percent of points against beginners, 50 percent against intermediate players, and 34 percent of points against advanced and advanced+ players.</li><li>When asked if they would like to play against the robot again on a scale of 1 (definitely not) to 5 (definitely yes), the average response was 4.87.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Roboticists have been programming robot arms to play table tennis for at least a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIIJME8-au8&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--c0nG4TrrE_gYiMOvohUdxm_ANhEP0mYcqOgXNWmXHOWcndvgdoLpuW6EwUysfUV6JX5kw\" rel=\"noopener\">decade</a>. Earlier projects enabled robots to perform various aspects of the game, like aiming at a specific target or smashing, but none tackled complete gameplay against competitive human opponents. Breaking the problem into two parts — a library of individual skills (low-level controllers) and an algorithm that chooses which to use — simplifies the task. Weaknesses in the robot’s performance (for example, difficulty returning underspin) can be addressed by adding a skill that compensates.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Even expert players had enough fun playing against this robot to want to play more. That’s a successful gaming
