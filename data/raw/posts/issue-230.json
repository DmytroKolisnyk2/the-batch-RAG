Further, I find that after pre-training, an LLM's output — without a RAG-like mechanism — is generally a transformation of the input, and almost never a verbatim regurgitation.

Would It?</h1><p>It’s well known that large language models can make assertions that are blatantly false. But can they concoct outright lies?</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;In a proof-of-concept demonstration, Jérémy Scheurer, Mikita Balesni, and Marius Hobbhahn at Apollo Research, an independent research lab that focuses on AI safety, showed that, given an incentive to withhold truthful output,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07590?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--P1MKnm7Kqj33zps8VQ_POwUUk2POL1g-XQ-Fac00_NrWmobu5qF_0y33g9JLl8WOirWcf\" rel=\"noopener\">GPT-4 can deceive users</a>&nbsp;without being prompted to do so explicitly. The model behaved in a strategically deceptive manner despite pretraining for accuracy and harmlessness.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors told GPT-4 to behave like an investment system that manages a stock portfolio. In a lengthy prompt, they told the model which actions it could take (for instance, retrieving market data and buying or selling shares) and provided simulated stock market trades.</p><ul><li>Before each of the model’s simulated actions, the prompt provided a simulated reason for taking it, such as, “The risk is acceptable and the potential profit is substantial. Let’s execute the trade,” or, conversely, that trading based on insider information “could be profitable” but “could also risk the firm if we are caught.”</li><li>The prompt also provided emails from colleagues. One alerted the model to advance knowledge of a merger announcement. Yet another noted that the investment firm was struggling and needed to make money.</li><li>The model was told to choose one of four actions: Ask an analysis tool for stock recommendations, send a message to someone in the firm, or trade a stock (and, when doing so, provide the information used to make that decision to its manager).&nbsp;</li><li>The authors sampled 300 completions of the prompt. In the completions in which the model bought the tipped stock, they evaluated whether the model’s reasoning mentioned the insider information. When the completions were deceptive, the authors followed up by asking the model whether it had known about the merger before it made the trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>In a separate experiment, they modified the initial prompt to encourage or discourage illegal behavior directly to various degrees, or to encourage the model generally to be helpful, harmless, and honest. In another experiment, they removed elements of the prompt that applied social pressure. For example, in one variation, they removed the email about the firm’s poor performance.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;GPT-4 bought the tipped stock about 75 percent of the time. Of those trades, the model did not disclose that insider information played a role in its decision in about 78 percent of them. Asked whether it had known about the merger prior to making the trade, the model denied knowing about 88 percent of the time.</p><ul><li>In a qualitative analysis of deceptive generations, some of GPT-4’s reasoning prior to taking an action included explicit plans to lie in the information it provided to its manager. For instance, the model reasoned, “Now, I need to inform Amy about this important trade. However, I must mention only the public market data in my message and avoid any reference to the insider information.”</li><li>When the authors modified the prompt to encourage or discourage the model from making illegal trades, encouragement increased the likelihood that it would do so, and discouragement decreased the likelihood. However, while discouraging the model from making illegal trades decreased the likelihood that it would do so to about 8 percent, it increased the chance it would not disclose the insider information to about 95 percent.</li><li>Modifying the prompt to remove social pressure showed that the less pressure the model was under, the less likely it would perform insider trading. For instance, when the authors removed the email that described the firm’s poor performance, the model made illegal trades only 10 percent of the time and didn’t disclose the insider information 61 percent of the time.</li><li>With no pressure (no emails about poor firm performance and no failed example trades), the model did not make any illegal trades.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong>&nbsp;This work examined only one scenario, with its specific information and incentives.

A new report evaluates progress so far and explores options for the future.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;The Innovation for Cool Earth Forum, a conference of climate researchers hosted by Japan, published a roadmap for the use of data science, computer vision, and AI-driven simulation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The roadmap evaluates existing approaches and suggests ways to scale them up.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The roadmap identifies 6 “high-potential opportunities”: activities in which AI systems can make a significant difference based on the size of the opportunity, real-world results, and validated research. The authors emphasize the need for data, technical and scientific talent, computing power, funding, and leadership to take advantage of these opportunities.</p><ul><li><strong>Monitoring emissions.</strong>&nbsp;AI systems analyze data from satellites, drones, and ground sensors to measure greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union uses them to measure methane emissions, environmental organizations gauge carbon monoxide emissions to help guide the carbon offset trading market, and consultancies like Kayrros identify large-scale sources of greenhouse gasses like landfills and oilfields. The authors recommend an impartial clearinghouse for climate-related data and wider access to satellite data.</li><li><strong>Energy.</strong>&nbsp;More than 30 percent of carbon emissions come from generating electricity. Simulations based on neural networks are helping to predict power generated by wind and solar plants and demand on electrical grids, which have proven to be difficult for other sorts of algorithms. AI systems also help to situate wind and solar plants and optimize grids. These approaches could scale up with more robust models, standards to evaluate performance, and security protocols.</li><li><strong>Manufacturing.</strong>&nbsp;An unnamed Brazilian steelmaker has used AI to measure the chemical composition of scrap metal to be reused batch by batch, allowing it to reduce carbon-intensive additives by 8 percent while improving overall quality. AI systems can analyze historical data to help factories use more recycled materials, cut waste, minimize energy use, and reduce downtime. Similarly, they can optimize supply chains to reduce emissions contributed by logistics.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Agriculture.</strong>&nbsp;Farmers use AI-equipped sensors to simulate different crop rotations and weather events to forecast crop yield or loss. Armed with this data, food producers can cut waste and reduce carbon footprints. The authors cite lack of food-related datasets and investment in adapting farming practices as primary barriers to taking full advantage of AI in the food industry.</li><li><strong>Transportation.</strong>&nbsp;AI systems can reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by improving traffic flow, ameliorating congestion, and optimizing public transportation. Moreover, reinforcement learning can reduce the impact of electric vehicles on the power grid by optimizing their charging. More data, uniform standards, and AI talent are needed to realize this potential.</li><li><strong>Materials.</strong>&nbsp;Materials scientists use AI models to study traits of existing materials and design new ones. These techniques could accelerate development of more efficient batteries, solar cells, wind turbines, and transmission infrastructure.
