Facebook researchers used a similar technique on sequences of mathematical symbols, training a model to map math problems to math solutions.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Guillaume Lample and Francois Charton built a sequence-to-sequence <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01412?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">model</a> that solves integrals and ordinary differential equations.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> To apply machine translation to math, an equation must be represented as a sequence of characters that capture its semantics. A mathematical expression represented as a tree — with operators as internal nodes and operands as leaves — maps unambiguously to a sequence. For example, the image above shows the tree for 2 + 3*(5+2). The corresponding sequence is [+ 2 * 3 + 5 2].<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors used existing math software to generate datasets consisting of (problem, solution) pairs for integrals and ordinary differential equations. For each type of problem, they trained a separate transformer model to predict solutions.</p><ul><li>For function integration, the authors generated three datasets by differentiating a proposed solution, integrating a proposed problem (using SymPy), and integration by parts.</li><li>Similarly, they generated datasets for first- and second-order ordinary differential equations starting with randomly generated functions.</li><li>The models presented their results using a beam search with beam sizes [1, 10, 50]. This allowed them to consider a greater variety of possible solutions before making a final decision.</li><li>Since solutions to problems of these types are easy to verify, the model was able to validate its output. In many cases, all solutions in the beam were equivalent.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The transformer model beat Mathematica, Matlab, and Maple on integration for the dataset generated by differentiating the solution (98.4 percent accuracy with beam size 1 compared to 84 percent for Mathematica, the best of those three math apps). It also beat the math software on differential equations with beam sizes 10 and 50. The model solved integration problems in the test set that SymPy couldn’t, showing that it generalized beyond the program used to generate its training dataset.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Transformer networks can solve problems that dedicated commercial math programs can’t. That said, their solutions may not be 100 percent accurate.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Beating Mathematica is a remarkable result. Assuming the data distributions for training and test represented the most common problems in integrals and ordinary differential equations, this approach could open a vast frontier to state-of-the-art machine learning.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-optimize-1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Excerpt from The Squire, an AI written short film\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"here-be-dragons\">Here Be Dragons</h2><p>AI is contributing to paintings, music, and now a whimsical fantasy video.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx-2PyrhnFE&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\"><em>The Squire</em></a> is an amateur romp through a snowy realm of knights in armor and damsels in distress.

The program generated an internal context statement and fed it to the text engine, which responded: “You are Jake, a squire living in the kingdom of Larion…” It asked them periodically for input and generated text to advance the story. When the program declared, “GAME OVER!,” they set about planning the production.</p><ul><li>Unlike earlier text-adventure games, AI Dungeon 2 has no rules for how players can respond to prompts and no pre-programmed outcomes — everything is generated on the fly. The game’s creator, Nick Walton, <a href=\"https://pcc.cs.byu.edu/2019/11/21/ai-dungeon-2-creating-infinitely-generated-text-adventures-with-deep-learning-language-models/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">fine-tuned</a> the 1.5 billion-parameter version of GPT-2 on 30 megabytes of text scraped from an online choose-your-own-adventure <a href=\"http://www.chooseyourstory.com/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">forum</a>.</li><li>The game is prone to unexpected and occasionally nonsensical twists, such as when roadside bandits hand their sword to the befuddled Squire simply because he asks them to. But it anchors each session in its setting and narrative by feeding GPT-2 the previous 10 prompts, along with the original context statement, each time the player enters a new prompt, Walton told <em><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/the-creator-of-ai-dungeon-2-shares-gpt-2-finetuning-advice-e5800df407c9?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Towards Data Science</a></em>.</li><li>Inspired by the model <a href=\"https://www.groundai.com/project/ctrl-a-conditional-transformer-language-model-for-controllable-generation/1?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">CTRL</a>, he imposed a penalty whenever the system reused previously generated words. That keeps the text generator from repeating itself, which can be a problem with the latest language models.</li></ul><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> In the early days of generated music, some listeners enjoyed the jarring notes that computers often came up with. We’re still in the early days of generated narrative, but the results, for all their screwball turns, can be delightful.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1_1200x675.JAN.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>How can you advance your AI career as a machine learning engineer, data scientist, or software engineer?
