This is because building evals is viewed as a massive investment (say, creating 100 or 1,000 examples, and designing and validating metrics) and there’s never a convenient moment to put in that up-front cost. Instead, I encourage teams to think of building evals as an iterative process. It’s okay to start with a quick-and-dirty implementation (say, 5 examples with unoptimized metrics) and then iterate and improve over time. This allows you to gradually shift the burden of evaluations away from humans and toward automated evals.</p><p>I&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/we-need-better-evals-for-llm-applications/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8_FZ-k139bkaCkF4mFB_yCDFgWpbSutrss2x6jmYppbpKVs6G9jtGyW9TvuC9eQ2s91iOP\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>&nbsp;previously&nbsp;about the importance and difficulty of creating evals. Say you’re building a customer-service chatbot that responds to users in free text. There’s no single right answer, so many teams end up having humans pore over dozens of example outputs with every update to judge if it improved the system. While techniques like LLM-as-judge are helpful, the details of getting this to work well (such as what prompt to use, what context to give the judge, and so on) are finicky to get right. All this contributes to the impression that building evals requires a large up-front investment, and thus on any given day, a team can make more progress by relying on human judges than figuring out how to build automated evals.</p><p>I encourage you to approach building evals differently. It’s okay to build quick evals that are only partial, incomplete, and noisy measures of the system’s performance, and to iteratively improve them. They can be a complement to, rather than replacement for, manual evaluations. Over time, you can gradually tune the evaluation methodology to close the gap between the evals’ output and human judgments. For example:</p><ul><li>It’s okay to start with very few examples in the eval set, say 5, and gradually add to them over time — or subtract them if you find that some examples are too easy or too hard, and not useful for distinguishing between the performance of different versions of your system.</li><li>It’s okay to start with evals that measure only a subset of the dimensions of performance you care about, or measure narrow cues that you believe are correlated with, but don’t fully capture, system performance. For example if, at a certain moment in the conversation, your customer-support agent is supposed to (i) call an API to issue a refund and (ii) generate an appropriate message to the user, you might start off measuring only whether or not it calls the API correctly and not worry about the message. Or if, at a certain moment, your chatbot should recommend a specific product, a basic eval could measure whether or not the chatbot mentions that product without worrying about what it says about it.</li></ul><p>So long as the output of the evals correlates with overall performance, it’s fine to measure only a subset of things you care about when starting.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/unnamed--58-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Cartoon of two coworkers coding; one struggles with evaluations, the other iterates quickly through model updates and test cases.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/unnamed--58-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/unnamed--58-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/unnamed--58-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>The development process thus comprises two iterative loops, which you might execute in parallel:</p><ul><li>Iterating on the system to make it perform better, as measured by a combination of automated evals and human judgment;</li><li>Iterating on the evals to make them correspond more closely to human judgment.</li></ul><p>As with many things in AI, we often don’t get it right the first time. So t’s better to build an initial end-to-end system quickly and then iterate to improve it. We’re used to taking this approach to building AI systems. We can build evals the same way.</p><p>To me, a successful eval meets the following criteria. Say, we currently have system A, and we might tweak it to get a system B:</p><ul><li>If A works significantly better than B according to a skilled human judge, the eval should give A a significantly higher score than B.</li><li>If A and B have similar performance, their eval scores should be similar.</li></ul><p>Whenever a pair of systems A and B contradicts these criteria, that is a sign the eval is in “error” and we should tweak it to make it rank A and B correctly. This is a similar philosophy to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoAxZsdw_3w&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8_FZ-k139bkaCkF4mFB_yCDFgWpbSutrss2x6jmYppbpKVs6G9jtGyW9TvuC9eQ2s91iOP\" rel=\"noopener\">error analysis</a>&nbsp;in building machine learning algorithms, only instead of focusing on errors of the machine learning algorithm's output — such as when it outputs an incorrect label — we focus on “errors” of the evals — such as when they incorrectly rank two systems A and B, so the evals aren’t helpful in choosing between them.</p><p>Relying purely on human judgment is a great way to get started on a project. But for many teams, building evals as a quick prototype and iterating to something more mature lets you put in evals earlier and accelerate your progress.</p><p>Keep building!</p><p>Andrew</p><hr><h2

Board member Helen Toner later learned that only one had been approved.</li><li>Altman also failed to tell the board that Microsoft had tested GPT-4 in India without the&nbsp;committee’s approval.</li><li>Board members were surprised to learn that Altman personally owned the $175 million OpenAI Startup Fund, so OpenAI investors wouldn’t see any profits. Altman claimed he didn’t benefit from the fund.</li><li>CTO Mira Murati expressed doubts about Altman’s leadership to other board members. Murati, Toner, and co-founder Ilya Sutskever began to document his&nbsp;actions.</li><li>On November 16, the board voted to fire Altman and appoint&nbsp;Murati interim CEO. The board members were reluctant to reveal why they’d fired Altman. At one meeting, Murati and other executives gave them 30 minutes to either explain why they fired Altman, resign, or watch the executive team quit.&nbsp;Nearly all OpenAI employees (including Murati and Sutskever) signed a letter threatening to quit if Altman wasn't reinstated, and the board reversed its decision.</li></ul><p><strong>Aftermath:</strong>&nbsp;Since Altman’s return, Murati and all but one director who voted to remove him&nbsp;have left OpenAI.

Their approach: Eliminate the tokenizer and instead integrate a system that learns to group input characters.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;Artidoro Pagnoni, Ram Pasunuru, and collaborators at Meta, University of Washington, and University of Chicago introduced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09871?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-afztMUszJ_VV6AKiEzLFAMzdZhNGggAm8i1kx46WQ-JHHfAq84GquslgvqD9JuJttKDF\" rel=\"noopener\">Byte Latent Transformer</a>&nbsp;(BLT), a system of transformers that processes groups of text characters (in the form of bytes) directly.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;A tokenizer turns bytes (characters) into tokens (a word or part of a word) based on learned rules: Specific sequences map to particular tokens. A large language model (LLM) would be more efficient if its tokenizer considered how easy or difficult it would be to predict the next token, because then it could group tokens that commonly occur together, thus saving memory and processing power. For instance, to complete the phrase, “The capital of the United States is,” a tokenizer may generate “Washington”, then “D”, then “.C”, and finally “.” — even though it’s easy to predict that “D.C.” will follow “Washington” (that is, the number of viable options is very small). Conversely, generating the token after “D.C.” is harder, since many viable options exist. Using a small LLM to estimate the difficulty of predicting the next token enables the model to split difficult-to-predict text into smaller groups while packing easier-to-predict text into larger groups.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;BLT comprises four transformers (8 billion parameters total): (i) a small byte-level transformer, (ii) an encoder transformer, (iii) a so-called latent transformer, and (iv) a decoder transformer.

The authors used entropy, a measure of uncertainty, to decide how bytes should be grouped. If the predicted probabilities were concentrated in a particular byte value (low entropy), meaning the next byte was highly predictable, the byte was added to the current group. If the probabilities were more spread out across multiple byte values (high entropy), meaning the model was less certain, it was part of a new group.</li><li>The encoder transformer learned to represent each group as a vector, while attending to preceding bytes for context.</li><li>The latent transformer learned to generate the next group vector from all previous group vectors.</li><li>Finally, the decoder transformer learned to reconstruct a byte sequence from a sequence of vectors.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;On seven benchmarks that test general language and coding abilities, BLT achieved an average accuracy of 61.1 percent, outperforming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21783?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-afztMUszJ_VV6AKiEzLFAMzdZhNGggAm8i1kx46WQ-JHHfAq84GquslgvqD9JuJttKDF\" rel=\"noopener\">Llama 3</a>&nbsp;(8 billion parameters and a similar number of floating point operations to BLT) at 60.0 percent.</p><ul><li>BLT achieved 80.6 percent on the common-sense question and answer benchmark&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07830?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-afztMUszJ_VV6AKiEzLFAMzdZhNGggAm8i1kx46WQ-JHHfAq84GquslgvqD9JuJttKDF\" rel=\"noopener\">HellaSwag</a>, while Llama 3 (8 billion parameters and a similar number of floating point operations to BLT) achieved 79.1 percent.</li><li>BLT demonstrated significantly higher resilience to noisy inputs compared to Llama 3, particularly in tasks involving character manipulation, spelling variations, and languages for which relatively little data is available. For example, in the CUTE spelling benchmark, which tests a model’s ability to recognize correctly spelled words, BLT achieved 99.9 percent accuracy while Llama 3 achieved 1.1 percent accuracy.</li><li>BLT outperformed Llama 3 in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2022.tacl-1.30/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-afztMUszJ_VV6AKiEzLFAMzdZhNGggAm8i1kx46WQ-JHHfAq84GquslgvqD9JuJttKDF\" rel=\"noopener\">translating to English across 26 languages</a>&nbsp;(including 20 with little data).

For instance, when prompted to insert a \"z\" after every \"n\" in \"not\", Llama 3 incorrectly completed it as \"znotz\". This happened because its tokenizer treats \"not\" as a single, indivisible token. In contrast, BLT correctly generated \"nzot,\" because it can dynamically regroup bytes and draw new boundaries. In a more practical case, instead of treating \"pizya\" and \"pizza\" as different tokens, BLT recognizes that they share nearly identical byte sequences, differing only in the bytes for \"y\" and \"z\", and therefore likely mean the same thing.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;In some alternatives to traditional tokenization, an LLM might process much longer sequences because the number of bytes in a sentence is much larger than the number of words. This work addresses that issue by grouping bytes dynamically. The tradeoff is complexity: Instead of one transformer, we have four.</p>","comment_id":"6800341c7bd4e30001b445d5","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/unnamed--58--1.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2025-04-16T15:50:04.000-07:00","updated_at":"2025-04-30T16:05:27.000-07:00","published_at":"2025-04-16T16:08:00.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"The
