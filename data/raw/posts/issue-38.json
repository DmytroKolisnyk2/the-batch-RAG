It even mimics the voices of greats like Frank Sinatra.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Jukebox generates music by drawing from a database of 1.2 million songs. Where some other AI-powered systems use symbolic generators to create tunes, Jukebox uses audio recordings, which capture more of music’s subtleties.</p><ul><li>In working with raw audio, the biggest bottleneck is its sheer size and complexity, the authors write. They used vector quantized variational autoencoders, or VQ-VAEs, to compress the training set to a lower-dimensional space. Then they trained the model to generate audio in this compressed space. Transformers create successively higher-resolution versions of a new song. Finally, a decoder turns that output into audio.</li><li>The researchers paired each song with metadata including its artist, lyrics, and genre. That helps guide the model as it generates made-to-order music in any designated style.</li><li>The model made cohesive music, but it struggled to produce coherent lyrics. To overcome this, researchers added existing lyrics into the conditioning information. It also had a hard time associating chunks of words with musically appropriate passages, so the researchers used open source tools to manually align words with the music windows in which they appear.</li><li>The model requires upward of nine hours of processing to render one minute of audio.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> OpenAI released over <a href=\"https://jukebox.openai.com/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">7,000 songs</a> composed by Jukebox.

Even two training examples from an unrelated generator improved the discriminator’s ability to recognize fake images.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers compared the performance of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">ProGAN</a>’s discriminator when trained on Pro-GAN output and on their own dataset.</p><ul><li>The training set comprised 18,000 real images and 18,000 Pro-GAN images from the 20 object categories in the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03365?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">LSUN</a> dataset, along with augmented versions of those images. The validation set consisted of 100 real and synthetic images per category. The researchers created the Foresynth test dataset that consists of real and synthetic images from 11 GANs.</li><li>Blur and compression were applied to the training data, though the testing wasn’t performed on augmented images.</li><li>Augmentation improved performance on the whole, though some GANs evaded detection better than others.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> ProGAN’s discriminator distinguished real from fake images 80 percent of the time. Accuracy rose to 82.3 percent by adding two training examples from another generator (and allowing the discriminator to adjust its confidence threshold) and 88.6 percent with many examples. The researchers also compared real images used to train the generators with 2,000 fake images from each one. They found no discernible pattern in a frequency representation of real images and distinctive patterns in the output of all generators. These subtle patterns, they conjecture, enabled the discriminator to generalize to the output of unrelated generators.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> The authors’ approach to detecting fake images does a fairly good job of spotting run-of-the-mill GAN output. But a determined malefactor could use only generated images that evaded their method.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Prior research didn’t envision that a single discriminator could learn to recognize fakes from diverse, unrelated generators. Current generators apparently leave common traces — a hopeful prospect for developing more capable fake detectors. Of course, that could change tomorrow.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Your move, fakers.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Israel4.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Animated pie chart\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"triage-for-pandemic-patients\">Triage for Pandemic Patients</h3><p>Israeli and American hospitals are using an algorithm to flag individuals at high risk for Covid-19 complications.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Israel’s Maccabi Healthcare Services and U.S.-based Kaiser Permanente are using a model dubbed <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/il/news-releases/earlysign-announces-availability-of-ai-clinical-risk-predictor-for-covid-19-301048356.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Covid Complications AlgoMarker</a> to identify patients likely to be hospitalized, develop complications, or die from Covid-19.

The authors propose contrastive learning to extract features during RL.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> In many RL scenarios, the model learns by interacting with its environment. To extract features, it must capture training data while learning, so pre-trained feature extractors don’t generalize well to novel situations. Contrastive learning, which has been successfully applied to self-supervised learning, extracts similar features for similar inputs and dissimilar features for dissimilar inputs. This doesn’t require pre-training, so the researchers figured that reinforcement and contrastive learning could go hand-in-hand.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors essentially combined an RL agent of the user’s choice with a high-performance contrastive learning model that draws techniques from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">SimCLR</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">MoCo</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09272?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">CPC</a>.

CURL cuts the data requirement.<br><strong><br>We’re thinking:</strong> We’ve been excited about self-supervised learning for some time and are glad to see these techniques being applied to speed up RL as well.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AsiaASPECT.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Map of Asia with AI letters inside a location icon\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"asia%E2%80%99s-ai-advantage\">Asia’s AI Advantage</h3><p>Asian companies lead the world in AI deployment, new research argues.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Market research by <em><a href=\"https://mittrinsights.s3.amazonaws.com/AIagenda2020/AsiaAIagenda.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">MIT Technology Review Insights</a></em> found that companies in the Asia-Pacific region are using machine learning faster and with better results than any other part of the world.<br><br><strong>What they found:</strong> The authors interviewed over 1,000 executives and directors from businesses in a range of economic sectors around the globe. Roughly one-fifth work for companies in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><ul><li>Ninety-six percent of the Asian executives interviewed said their companies were using AI, compared to 85 percent in the rest of the world. Both numbers have increased sharply since 2017.</li><li>Asian companies appear to be getting the most benefit from the technology, too. Forty-six percent of Asia-Pacific executives reported that their AI investments were exceeding expectations, as opposed to 37 percent of executives elsewhere.</li><li>Their businesses are using AI mostly to manage information technology, improve customer service, and conduct research and development.</li><li>Use of AI in sales and marketing is on the rise. While a third of Asian respondents have deployed models in these areas, 61 percent plan to by 2023. E-commerce sales driven by Covid-19, the authors say, will add momentum to AI-powered online customer service.</li></ul><p><strong>Data-driven growth:</strong> Nearly half of Asian executives surveyed said their companies’ AI ambitions were hindered by a lack of access to high-quality data. Most said that better legal protections and industry standards regarding data privacy and security would make them more willing to share datasets with other companies. Third-party data-sharing platforms like Singapore’s nonprofit <a href=\"https://oceanprotocol.com/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Ocean Protocol</a> could be part of the solution, the authors write.<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Several Asia-Pacific governments have provided major support for IT infrastructure.</p><ul><li>South Korea <a href=\"https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/south-korea-commits-us4bn-to-bolster-tech-sectors/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">committed $4 billion</a> last summer toward research and development including AI.</li><li>Singapore provides worthy startups with <a href=\"https://www.imda.gov.sg/programme-listing/accreditation-at-sgd?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">accreditation</a> that helps attract investors.</li><li>In 2017, China released a <a href=\"http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2017-07/20/content_5211996.htm?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">national AI plan</a> that includes a $2 billion R&amp;D center near Beijing.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The survey shows that AI is thriving in places where the government provides both regulatory clarity and institutional support.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Every country should develop policies to foster AI development or risk getting left behind.</p>","comment_id":"60c04eba274d5b003b106695","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/06/Andrew-Letter-ASPECT-1-1.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2021-06-08T22:16:42.000-07:00","updated_at":"2022-10-07T07:22:35.000-07:00","published_at":"2020-05-06T12:00:00.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"There has been a lot of excitement about the idea of using deep learning to diagnose diabetic retinopathy: That is by taking a photo of the retina and using AI to detect signs of disease.
