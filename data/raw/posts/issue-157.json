As we work to reduce bias in AI models, though, it’s also worth exploring a different issue: inconsistency.

Judges are only human, and if they’re swayed by football outcomes, imagine how many other irrelevant factors may influence their decisions!</em></p><p><em>Many human decisions rest on complex criteria, and humans don’t always define their criteria before weighing them. For example:</em></p><ul><li><em>In medicine, I’ve seen individual doctors make highly inconsistent diagnoses given the same input. Working on a project with a doctor whom I’ll call Alice, we measured the “inter-Alice agreement score,” which was loosely a measure of how much her diagnoses differed between morning and afternoon. (For the record, Alice is a brilliant doctor and wonderful collaborator. This score measured the inherent ambiguity of the task more than it measured her competence.)</em></li><li><em>In manufacturing, I’ve seen skilled inspectors make very different decisions about whether or not parts with similar flaws were defective.</em></li><li><em>In online retailing, I’ve seen human annotators make inconsistent decisions about how to tag or categorize products. (Should a fun gadget go under electronics or entertainment?)</em></li></ul><p><em>In contrast, given the same input, a trained neural network will produce the same output every time. Given similar inputs, a trained model will also typically output similar results. Automated software tends to be highly consistent. This is one of automation’s huge advantages: Algorithms make decisions much more consistently than humans. To my mind, they offer a way to give patients more consistent and fair treatment options, make manufacturing more efficient, make retail product catalogs less confusing to shoppers, and so on.</em><br><br><em>In conversations about whether and how to build an AI system, it’s important to address how to ensure that the system doesn’t have significant bias as well as how to benchmark its bias against human bias. If you’re trying to get an AI project approved, you may find it useful raise the issue of consistency as well. Measuring the consistency of your algorithm relative to humans who make the same decision can add weight to arguments in favor of investing in an automated system.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/08/PHARMA.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Animated graphs and maps show global hiring trends for AI jobs in the pharma industry.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/PHARMA.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/08/PHARMA.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/08/PHARMA.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"ai-jobs-grow-in-pharma\">AI Jobs Grow in Pharma</h1><hr><p>New data suggests the drug industry is hooked on AI.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Pharmaceutical companies in several countries are hiring machine learning engineers at increasing rates, industry news publication <em>Pharmaceutical Technology</em> <a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVStLW1QPLmkVYkymk5W-ZHRW99f7mw4Nz4mdMVmxVc5nCT_V3Zsc37CgZ5mW953wQ421jHwCW10yYvr5HyY5DN4bYZVQmqYzQW6HTrYX6ZQ_SqW7Pw0Lc8Kzc5rW7LXgD7405vR9W1r9Tmj8nPzhyW5SstbG3Hhj9pW3LZqCH7Cx55ZW8jdCMr2Sd9PmV9Jg-d3wL1s0W6ZD6Qr5J7hgKW5X9lGF4c6y3-W5bYLVG7cPDbCVr9zrM5My-qFW3xjCl63Cfj5vW8nyT6P5DvXlfW55ll607ZBvyzW3gSr0k5h5hb5W3z34bK57LgrgW8QRWWP8HYgZlW6S1z0357RpbfN6h2s3wJJsCNW24NS-F80JKQgW6nhFnV4l8N6sW2dT8Xb5KMvTLN7383tvmbGDXV8WJ1f8VGVw5W7CRSwl7TTKBWV9KL5C8XbTdWV1h_Wt47yX7nW8l87p-6cC_wNW3hwrjK1VSrR4W3TMKS-4wHL5w3fnF1?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>.
