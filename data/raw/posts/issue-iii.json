During a lull in the procedure, they had the patients read English-language texts aloud. They recorded the fluctuating voltage as the brain controlled the muscles involved in speaking. Later, they fed the voltage measurements into a synthesizer. You can hear the synthesized speech in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbX9FLJ6WKw&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">video</a>.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> A pair of three-layer, bidirectional, LSTM recurrent neural networks drove the synthesis.</p><ul><li>One model used the neural activity to predict motions of the lips, jaw, tongue, and larynx.</li><li>The other used those predictions to identify corresponding consonant, vowel, and other sounds.</li><li>The second model’s output fed a synthesizer that rendered speech sounds.</li><li>Listeners on Amazon Mechanical Turk transcribed the synthesized sentences, achieving 83% median accuracy.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The technique could help people who have lost the ability to control their vocal tract due to disorders such as Lou Gehrig’s disease, stroke, or injury. People with such conditions — think of the late physicist Stephen Hawking — can communicate very slowly through systems that track eye movements or facial muscles to spell words one letter at a time. Translating brain impulses directly would allow them to communicate with the ease of normal speech. <br><br><strong>Reality check: </strong>The researchers did not read minds. Gopala K. Anumanchipalli, Josh Chartier, and Edward F. Chang read brain signals controlling the patients’ muscles. Still, their approach conceivably could be refined to translate brain signals associated with thought.<br><br><strong>What’s next: </strong>The team plans to test the technology in people who can’t move their face and tongue. It also aims to adapt the system for languages other than English.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/09/76127ad4-1bd3-4c67-a239-9d34c0d27046.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of adversarial patches against YOLOv2\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1116\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/76127ad4-1bd3-4c67-a239-9d34c0d27046.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/76127ad4-1bd3-4c67-a239-9d34c0d27046.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/09/76127ad4-1bd3-4c67-a239-9d34c0d27046.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/09/76127ad4-1bd3-4c67-a239-9d34c0d27046.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h2 id=\"hiding-in-plain-sight\">Hiding in Plain Sight</h2><p>Harry Potter’s magical cloak made him invisible to his Hogwarts colleagues. Now researchers have created a sort of invisibility shield to hide people from computer vision.<br><br><strong>What’s new: </strong>The researchers created an adversarial patch that makes people invisible to the YOLOv2 object detection model. Hold the patch in front of a camera, and YOLOv2 can’t see anything. In this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MIbFvK2S9g8?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">video</a>, the befuddled recognizer seems to scratch its head as researchers pass the patch back and forth.<br><br><strong>How they did it: </strong>Simen Thys, Wiebe Van Ranst, and Toon Goedemé fed a variety of photos into a YOLOv2 network. They altered the photos to minimize the model’s \"objectness\" score. The image with the lowest score was an altered picture of people holding colorful umbrellas. They composited this image into photos of people, ran those through the network, and tweaked the patch further to achieve still lower objectness scores. <br><br><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Much research into adversarial attacks has focused on targets that don’t vary from instance to instance, such as stop signs or traffic lights. Held in front of a person, the new patch blinds YOLOv2 regardless of differences such as clothing, skin color, size, pose, or setting. It can be reproduced by a digital printer, making it practical for real-world attacks.<br><br><strong>The catch:</strong> The patch works only on YOLOv2. It doesn’t transfer well to different architectures. <br><br><strong>What’s next: </strong>The researchers contemplate generalizing the patch to confuse other recognizers. They also envision producing adversarial clothing. Perhaps a cloak?</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/09/066fb5f1-4c1f-49b5-8931-ec6ebe83e3de.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Musicians' names connected\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1147\" height=\"650\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/066fb5f1-4c1f-49b5-8931-ec6ebe83e3de.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/066fb5f1-4c1f-49b5-8931-ec6ebe83e3de.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/09/066fb5f1-4c1f-49b5-8931-ec6ebe83e3de.png 1147w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h2 id=\"birth-of-a-prodigy\">Birth of a Prodigy</h2><p>Never mind Spotify, here's MuseNet — a model that spins music endlessly in a variety of styles.<br><br><strong>What’s new: </strong>Computer-generated music composition dates back to the 1950s, but rarely has it been easy on the ears. The best examples, such the recent Google <a href=\"https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-johann-sebastian-bach?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">doodle</a> commemorating the birthday of J.S. Bach, stick with a single style. MuseNet has a fair grasp of styles from bluegrass to Lady Gaga, and it can combine them as well.<br><br><strong>How it works: </strong>Drawing on OpenAI's GPT-2 language model, MuseNet is a 72-layer transformer model with 24 attention heads. This architecture, plus embeddings that help the model keep track of musical features over time, give it a long memory for musical structure. It uses unsupervised learning to predict the next note for up to 10 instruments in compositions up to four minutes long.<br><br><strong>To be sure: </strong>Project lead (and Deep Learning Specialization graduate) Christine Payne is a Juilliard-trained pianist, and the model’s mimicry of piano masters such as Chopin and Mozart (or <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/openai_audio/song-of-the-day-musenet-improvises-chopin-from-mozarts-rondo-alla-turca/s-P6w6U?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">both</a>) is especially good. That said, MuseNet inhabits was trained on MIDI files and speaks through a general-purpose synthesizer, so its output often sounds stiff and artificial. Its understanding of harmony and form, while impressive for an algorithmic composer, is shallow, and it often meanders.<br><br><strong>Where to hear it: </strong>You can hear MuseNet <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY5omEwxWa8&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">here</a>. You can tinker with it <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/musenet/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">here</a> through May 12.
