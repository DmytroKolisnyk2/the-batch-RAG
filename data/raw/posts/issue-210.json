The proliferation of models with relatively permissive licenses gives developers more options for building applications.</em></p><p><em>Here are some different ways to build applications based on LLMs, in increasing order of cost/complexity:</em></p><ul><li><em><strong>Prompting. </strong>Giving a pretrained LLM instructions lets you build a prototype in minutes or hours </em><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/building-ai-systems-no-longer-requires-much-data/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><em>without a training set</em></a><em>. Earlier this year, I saw a lot of people start experimenting with prompting, and that momentum continues unabated. Several of our </em><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><em>short courses</em></a><em> teach best practices for this approach.</em></li><li><em><strong>One-shot or few-shot prompting.</strong> In addition to a prompt, giving the LLM a handful of examples of how to carry out a task ‚Äî the input and the desired output ‚Äî sometimes yields better results. </em></li><li><em><strong>Fine-tuning.</strong> An LLM that has been pretrained on a lot of text can be fine-tuned to your task by training it further on a small dataset of your own. The tools for fine-tuning are maturing, making it accessible to more developers.</em></li><li><em><strong>Pretraining.</strong> Pretraining your own LLM from scratch takes a lot of resources, so very few teams do it. In addition to general-purpose models pretrained on diverse topics, this approach has led to specialized models like BloombergGPT, which knows about finance, and Med-PaLM 2, which is focused on medicine.</em></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/08/unnamed--45--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Two coworkers interacting: - I prompted it to play Mozart. - Try Fine-Tuning!\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/unnamed--45--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/unnamed--45--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/08/unnamed--45--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>For most teams, I recommend starting with prompting, since that allows you to get an application working quickly. If you‚Äôre unsatisfied with the quality of the output, ease into the more complex techniques gradually. Start one-shot or few-shot prompting with a handful of examples. If that doesn‚Äôt work well enough, perhaps use RAG (retrieval augmented generation) to further improve prompts with key information the LLM needs to generate high-quality outputs. If that still doesn‚Äôt deliver the performance you want, then try fine-tuning ‚Äî but this represents a significantly greater level of complexity and may require hundreds or thousands more examples. To gain an in-depth understanding of these options, I highly recommend the course </em><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-with-llms/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Generative AI with Large Language Models</a><em>, created by AWS and DeepLearning.AI.</em></p><p><em>(Fun fact: A member of the DeepLearning.AI team has been trying to fine-tune Llama-2-7B to sound like me. I wonder if my job is at risk? üòú)</em></p><p><em>Additional complexity arises if you want to move to fine-tuning after prompting a proprietary model, such as GPT-4, that‚Äôs not available for fine-tuning. Is fine-tuning a much smaller model likely to yield superior results than prompting a larger, more capable model? The answer often depends on your application. If your goal is to change the style of an LLM‚Äôs output, then fine-tuning a smaller model can work well. However, if your application has been prompting GPT-4 to perform complex reasoning ‚Äî in which GPT-4 surpasses current open models ‚Äî it can be difficult to fine-tune a smaller model to deliver superior results.</em></p><p><em>Beyond choosing a development approach, it‚Äôs also necessary to choose a specific model. Smaller models require less processing power and work well for many applications, but larger models tend to have more knowledge about the world and better reasoning ability. I‚Äôll talk about how to make this choice in a future letter.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p><em>P.S.

Observations can be stored and retrieved to function like memories.</li><li>Just as people consolidate memories, an LLM can summarize them as reflections for later use.</li><li>To behave in a coherent way, an LLM can generate a plan and revise it as events unfold.</li></ul><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors designed 25 agents (represented by 2D sprites) who lived in a simulated town (a 2D background depicting the layout and the contents of its buildings) and let them run for two days. Each agent used <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_LukDvWZAbjr5nKga1lbAKisZXwdC2e0z9eseogyJ-byP93S1HrLuzOSUWOQjEes0tXV67\" rel=\"noopener\">GPT 3.5;</a> a database of actions, memories, reflections, and plans generated by GPT 3.5; and a server that tracked agent and object behaviors, locations (for instance, in the kitchen of Isabella‚Äôs apartment), and statuses (whether a stove was on or off), and relayed this information to agents when they came nearby.</p><ul><li>At each time step, the server gave each agent an observation that comprised what it last said it was doing, the objects and people in view, and their statuses.</li><li>Given an observation, an agent retrieved a memory based on recency, relevance, and importance. It measured relevance according to cosine similarity between embeddings of the observation and the memory. It rated importance by asking GPT-3.5 to score memories on a scale from ‚Äúmundane‚Äù (1) to ‚Äúpoignant‚Äù (10). Having retrieved the memory, the agent generated text that described its action, upon which the server updated the appropriate locations and statuses.</li><li>The reflection function consolidated the latest 100 memories a couple of times a day. Given 100 recent memories (say, what agent Klaus Mueller looked up at the library), the agent proposed 3 high-level questions that its memories could provide answers to (for instance, ‚ÄúWhat topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about?‚Äù). For each question, the agent retrieved relevant memories and generated five high-level insights (such as, ‚ÄúKlaus Mueller is dedicated to his research on gentrification‚Äù). Then it stored these insights in the memory.</li><li>Given general information about its identity and a summary of memories from the previous day, the agent generated a plan for the current day. Then it decomposed the plan into chunks an hour long, and finally into chunks that are minutes long (‚Äú4:00 p.m.: grab a light snack, such as a piece of fruit, a granola bar, or some nuts. 4:05 p.m.: ‚Ä¶‚Äù. The detailed plans went into the memory.</li><li>At each time step, the agent asked itself whether and how it should react to its observation given general information about its identity, its plan, and a summary of relevant memories. If it should react, the agent updated its plan and output a statement that describes its reactions. Otherwise, the agent generated a statement saying it would continue the existing plan. For example, a father might observe another agent and, based on a memory, identify it as his son who is currently working on a project. Then the father might decide to ask the son how the project is going.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The complete agents exhibited three types of emergent behavior: They spread information initially known only to themselves, formed relationships, and cooperated (specifically to attend a party). The authors gave 100 human evaluators access to all agent actions and memories. The evaluators asked the agents simple questions about their identities, behaviors, and thoughts. Then they ranked the agents‚Äô responses for believability. They also ranked versions of each agent that were missing one or more functions, as well as humans who stood in for each agent (‚Äúto identify whether the architecture passes a basic level of behavioral competency,‚Äù the authors write). These rankings were turned into a <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/trueskilltm-a-bayesian-skill-rating-system/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_LukDvWZAbjr5nKga1lbAKisZXwdC2e0z9eseogyJ-byP93S1HrLuzOSUWOQjEes0tXV67\" rel=\"noopener\">TrueSkill</a> score (a variation on the Elo system used in chess) for each agent type. The complete agent architecture scored highest, while the versions that lacked particular functions scored lower. Surprisingly, the human stand-ins also underperformed the complete agents.</p><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Some complete agents ‚Äúremembered‚Äù details they had not experienced. Others showed erratic behavior, like not recognizing that a one-person bathroom was occupied or that a business was closed. And they used oddly formal language in intimate conversation; one ended exchanges with her husband, ‚ÄúIt was good talking to you as always.‚Äù</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Large language models produce surprisingly human-like output. Combined with a database and server, they can begin to simulate human interactions. While the TrueSkill results don‚Äôt fully convey how humanly these agents behaved, they do suggest a role for such agents in fields like game development, social media, robotics, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04986?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_LukDvWZAbjr5nKga1lbAKisZXwdC2e0z9eseogyJ-byP93S1HrLuzOSUWOQjEes0tXV67\" rel=\"noopener\">epidemiology</a>.</p><p><strong>We're thinking:</strong> The evaluators found the human stand-ins less believable than the full-fledged agents.
