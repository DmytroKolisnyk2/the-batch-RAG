In addition, at 75, he has become “too old to do technical work,” he told <a href=\"http://technologyreview.com/2023/05/02/1072528/geoffrey-hinton-google-why-scared-ai/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_c7UOUWTjMOkx7mwWy5VxUu0hmTAphI20LozXiXoOgMIvy5rJGRoRUyNSrFMmT70WhU2KC\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>MIT Technology Review</em></a>. Instead, he will focus on philosophical matters. Among his concerns:</p><ul><li>Generated media could erode the average person’s ability to gauge reality.</li><li>AI models could cause massive unemployment by automating rote work, and perhaps not-so-rote work.</li><li>Automated code generators eventually could write programs that put humans at risk.</li><li>Hinton supports global regulation of AI but worries that it would be ineffective. Scientists probably can devise more effective safeguards than regulators, he said.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Hinton’s contributions to deep learning are myriad. Most notably, he helped popularize the use of backpropagation, the core algorithm for training neural networks; invented the dropout technique to avoid overfitting; and led development of AlexNet, which <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/what-alexnet-brought-to-the-world-of-deep-learning-46c7974b46fc?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_c7UOUWTjMOkx7mwWy5VxUu0hmTAphI20LozXiXoOgMIvy5rJGRoRUyNSrFMmT70WhU2KC\" rel=\"noopener\">revolutionized</a> image classification.

His concerns sound a note of caution for AI practitioners to evaluate the ethical dimensions of their work and stand by their principles.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Geoffrey Hinton first joined Google as a summer intern (!) at Google Brain when Andrew led that team.

In this case, the producers used fake — but realistic — imagery to stand in for reality. Despite the small-type disclaimer, the images make a visceral impression that fictional events are real, subverting the electorate's reliance on an accurate view of reality to decide which candidates to support. The power of such propaganda is likely to grow as generative video improves.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>This use of generated images as propaganda isn’t limited to political jockeying. Amnesty International recently tweeted — and sensibly deleted — a stirring image of a protester detained by Colombian police bearing the fine print, “Illustrations produced by artificial intelligence.” Organizations that seek to inform their audiences about real-world conditions counteract their own interests when they illustrate those conditions using fake images.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <strong><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></strong></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/05/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--11-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--11-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/05/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--11-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/05/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--11-.jpg 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/05/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--11-.jpg 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Learn new use cases for large language models and improve your ChatGPT API skills in our one-hour course, “ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers.” <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Sign up for free</a></p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/05/unnamed--59-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/05/unnamed--59-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"radio-stations-test-ai-djs\">Radio Stations Test AI DJs</h1><p>A language model will stand in for radio disk jockeys.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> RadioGPT <a href=\"https://futurimedia.com/futuri-launches-radiogpt/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_c7UOUWTjMOkx7mwWy5VxUu0hmTAphI20LozXiXoOgMIvy5rJGRoRUyNSrFMmT70WhU2KC\" rel=\"noopener\">generates</a> radio shows tailored for local markets.
