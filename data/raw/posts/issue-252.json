I believe we’re all better off if anyone can carry out basic AI research and share their innovations. Right now, I’m deeply concerned about California's proposed law&nbsp;<a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9fI9QstXaP4Ymya088giiFna5q8Io3XAtE183kvRgxaoDPVHs0eH9nRwmx06I7I6QFVfQu\" rel=\"noopener\">SB-1047</a>.&nbsp;It’s a long, complex bill with many parts that require safety assessments, shutdown capability for models, and so on.</p><p>There are many things wrong with this bill, but I’d like to focus here on just one: It defines an unreasonable “hazardous capability” designation that may make builders of large AI models potentially liable if someone uses their models to do something that exceeds the bill’s definition of harm (such as causing $500 million in damage). That is practically impossible for any AI builder to ensure. If the bill is passed in its present form, it will stifle AI model builders, especially open source developers.&nbsp;</p><p>Some AI applications, for example in healthcare, are risky. But as I wrote&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/keep-open-source-free/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9fI9QstXaP4Ymya088giiFna5q8Io3XAtE183kvRgxaoDPVHs0eH9nRwmx06I7I6QFVfQu\" rel=\"noopener\">previously</a>, regulators should regulate&nbsp;<em>applications</em>&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;<em>technology</em>.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Technology refers to tools that can be applied in many ways to solve various problems.</li><li>Applications are specific implementations of technologies designed to meet particular customer needs.</li></ul><p>For example, an electric motor is a technology. When we put it in a blender, an electric vehicle, dialysis machine, or guided bomb, it becomes an application. Imagine if we passed laws saying, if anyone uses a motor in a harmful way, the motor manufacturer is liable. Motor makers would either shut down or make motors so tiny as to be useless for most applications. If we pass such a law, sure, we might stop people from building guided bombs, but we’d also lose blenders, electric vehicles, and dialysis machines.&nbsp;In contrast, if we look at specific applications, like blenders, we can more rationally assess risks and figure out how to make sure they’re safe, and even ban classes of applications, like certain types of munitions.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/06/unnamed--62--1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/06/unnamed--62--1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/06/unnamed--62--1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/06/unnamed--62--1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Safety is a property of applications, not a property of technologies (or models), as Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/ai-safety-is-not-a-model-property?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9fI9QstXaP4Ymya088giiFna5q8Io3XAtE183kvRgxaoDPVHs0eH9nRwmx06I7I6QFVfQu\" rel=\"noopener\">pointed out</a>. Whether a blender is a safe one can’t be determined by examining the electric motor. A similar argument holds for AI. &nbsp;</p><p>SB-1047 doesn’t account for this distinction. It ignores the reality that the number of beneficial uses of AI models is, like electric motors, vastly greater than the number of harmful ones. But, just as no one knows how to build a motor that can’t be used to cause harm, no one has figured out how to make sure an AI model can’t be adapted to harmful uses. In the case of open source models, there’s no known defense to fine-tuning to remove RLHF alignment. And jailbreaking work has shown that even closed-source, proprietary models that have been properly aligned can be attacked in ways that make them give harmful responses. Indeed, the sharp-witted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/elder_plinius?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9fI9QstXaP4Ymya088giiFna5q8Io3XAtE183kvRgxaoDPVHs0eH9nRwmx06I7I6QFVfQu\" rel=\"noopener\">Pliny the Prompter</a>&nbsp;regularly tweets about jailbreaks for closed models.

I’m worried that this anti-competitive, anti-innovation proposal has gotten so much traction in the legislature. Worse, other jurisdictions often follow California, and it would be awful if they were to do so in this instance.</p><p>SB-1047 passed in a key vote in the State Senate in May, but it still has additional steps before it becomes law.

This year will see elections in at least 64 countries including most of the world’s most populous nations — a rich opportunity for AI-savvy propagandists. While propagandists have taken advantage of OpenAI’s models, the company was able to detect them and shut them down. More such efforts are bound to follow.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Generative AI’s potential to fuel propaganda is worth tracking and studying.

It can come even closer if the teacher also teaches reasoning techniques.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;Arindam Mitra and colleagues at Microsoft proposed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11045?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9fI9QstXaP4Ymya088giiFna5q8Io3XAtE183kvRgxaoDPVHs0eH9nRwmx06I7I6QFVfQu\" rel=\"noopener\">Orca 2</a>, a technique that improves the output of student LLMs an order of magnitude smaller than their teachers.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;Large language models can provide better output when they’re prompted to use a particular reasoning strategy such as think step by step, recall then generate, or explain then generate. Different reasoning strategies may yield better output depending on the task at hand. Moreover, given the same task, different models may perform better using different reasoning strategies. Consequently, in a teacher-student situation, the teacher and student models may need to use different strategies to achieve their highest performances on a given task. The student will achieve its best performance if it mimics the teacher's reasoning and response when the teacher uses not its own best-performing strategy, but the student’s best-performing strategy.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The teacher, GPT-4, helped generate a fine-tuning dataset to improve the output of the student,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9fI9QstXaP4Ymya088giiFna5q8Io3XAtE183kvRgxaoDPVHs0eH9nRwmx06I7I6QFVfQu\" rel=\"noopener\">Llama 2</a>&nbsp;(13 billion parameters), both of which had been pretrained.

(The authors don’t specify all the strategies they used.) They measured its performance on each task per reasoning strategy.</li><li>For each task, they prompted GPT-4 with all examples of that task, specifying the reasoning strategy that had enabled Llama 2 to achieve its highest performance on that task. In this way, GPT-4 augmented the dataset to include, for each prompt, both the response and the reasoning it used to arrive at it.&nbsp;</li><li>They fine-tuned Llama 2, given a prompt — without specifying the reasoning strategy — to produce the detailed reasoning and response generated by GPT-4.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors compared their model to models of similar size including WizardLM-13B (also based on Llama 2) and larger models including GPT-3.5 Turbo (an order of magnitude larger) and GPT-4 (parameter count undisclosed). They evaluated the percentage of correct responses on average over six reasoning benchmarks such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06364.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9fI9QstXaP4Ymya088giiFna5q8Io3XAtE183kvRgxaoDPVHs0eH9nRwmx06I7I6QFVfQu\" rel=\"noopener\">AGIEval</a>, which includes multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions from the Scholastic Aptitude Test, American Mathematics Competitions, and other tests designed for humans. Their model exactly matched the correct answer 66.92 percent of the time compared to WizardLM-13B (50.32 percent). It performed nearly as well as the 10x larger GPT-3.5 Turbo (which achieved 67.65 percent) but much less well than GPT-4 (which achieved 79.03 percent).</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Learning how to reason is an important complement to learning facts and perspectives. A model that has been trained to reason using its most effective strategy generally will provide better output. Users don’t need to tell it which strategy to apply. They can simply enter a prompt, and the model will figure out how to reason its response.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Perhaps a similar approach could be used to prompt a model to improve its own output. In effect, this would be similar to an agentic workflow designed to enable a model to produce its own training data, as recently&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-247/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9fI9QstXaP4Ymya088giiFna5q8Io3XAtE183kvRgxaoDPVHs0eH9nRwmx06I7I6QFVfQu\" rel=\"noopener\">described</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>The Batch</em>.</p>","comment_id":"6660ec5cfec9060001d7db3d","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/06/unnamed--62-.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2024-06-05T15:53:16.000-07:00","updated_at":"2024-08-12T07:42:11.000-07:00","published_at":"2024-06-05T16:09:39.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"The Batch AI News and Insights: The effort to protect innovation and open source continues.
