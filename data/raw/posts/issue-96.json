The system generated the design in six hours rather than the usual span of weeks, as detailed in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nature</a>.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Designing a chip is like playing a board game. A silicon wafer’s area resembles a board, parameters like macro counts and netlist topologies resemble pieces, and evaluation metrics resemble victory conditions. Reinforcement learning (RL) excels at meeting such challenges: Think of DeepMind’s AlphaGo — the RL model that, in 2015, became the first computer program to beat a Go master on a full-size board without a handicap.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> Google introduced its approach in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10746?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">paper</a> published last year.</p><ul><li>The authors pretrained a graph neural network for 48 hours on a dataset of 10,000 chip designs, generating transferrable representations of chips.</li><li>Although the pretraining was supervised, the loss function was based on RL. The input was the state associated with a given design, and the label was the reward for reduced wire length and congestion.</li><li>They fine-tuned the system for 6 hours using reinforcement learning.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers compared their system’s output to that of a human team who had designed an existing TPU. Their approach completed the task in a fraction of the time, and it either matched or outperformed the human team with respect to chip area, wire length, and power consumption.</p><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Google introduced the first TPU in 2015, and today the chips power Google services like search and translation and are available to developers via Google Cloud. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-launches-the-next-generation-of-its-custom-ai-chips/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Launched last month</a>, the fourth-generation TPU can train a ResNet-50 on ImageNet in <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/29/google-claims-its-new-tpus-are-2-7-times-faster-than-the-previous-generation/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1.82 minutes</a>.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> AI-powered chip design could cut the cost of bespoke chips, leading to an explosion of special-purpose processing for all kinds of uses.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Reinforcement learning is hot, and we’ve seen companies announce “RL” results that would be described more accurately as supervised learning. But this appears to be a genuine use of RL ideas, and it’s great to see this much-hyped approach used in a valuable commercial application.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/covid.gif?width=1200&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=covid.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Covid-19 over a graph\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"ai-against-covid-progress-report\">AI Against Covid: Progress Report</h2><p>A new report assessed how AI has helped address Covid-19 and where it has fallen short.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Machine learning systems haven’t lived up to their promise in some areas, but in others they’ve made a substantial impact, biomedical engineer Maxime Nauwynck wrote in <a href=\"https://thegradient.pub/how-has-ai-contributed-to-dealing-with-the-covid-19-pandemic/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Gradient</a>, an online journal of machine learning.</p><p><strong>Application areas:</strong> The author surveyed only systems specifically designed or adapted to fight Covid-19.</p><ul><li><strong>Clinical Applications:</strong> In the pandemic’s early months, hundreds of research papers described systems allegedly capable of diagnosing the illness from lung scans. <a href=\"https://www.alizila.com/how-damo-academys-ai-system-detects-coronavirus-cases/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Few</a> made it into clinical practice.

A new system removes that requirement.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Sumeet Singh and Sergey Karayev of Turnitin, a company that detects plagiarism, created a general-purpose <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06450?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">image-to-sequence model</a> that converts handwriting into text regardless of its layout and elements such as sketches, equations, and scratched-out deletions.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Handwriting recognition systems typically use separate models to segment pages into blocks of words and turn the writing into text. Neural networks allow an end-to-end approach. Convolutional neural networks are good at processing images, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">transformers</a> are good at extracting information from sequences.

In addition, they augmented examples by adding noise and changing brightness, contrast, scale, and rotation at random.</li><li>The data didn’t include labels for sketches, equations, and scratched-out deletions, so the system learned to ignore them. The variety of layouts encouraged the system to learn to transcribe text regardless of other elements.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> On IAM, the author’s system achieved a character error rate of 6.3 percent, while an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.08352.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LSTM designed for 2D</a> achieved 7.9 percent.
