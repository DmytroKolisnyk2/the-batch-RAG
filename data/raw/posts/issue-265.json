Based on what I saw there in government, business, and academia, the nation is well positioned to become a strong AI hub. When he asked me if I would advise South Korea as a member of the Global AI Strategy Steering Group of the country’s National AI Committee, I agreed on the spot. I was delighted to learn this week that Yann LeCun has also joined.&nbsp;I’ve been consistently impressed by the thoughtful approach the Korean government has taken toward AI, with an emphasis on investment and innovation and a realistic understanding of risks without being distracted by science-fiction scenarios of harm.</p><p>I’ve advised many countries to build AI for the sectors where they’re strong. For example, I felt that by investing in sectors like tourism and certain industries,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/thailands-ai-push/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QLV3stB3bwLzjBohF2UaWVwcaKjIvq6n7N_uFXp2PBA7QZzM5nYL7WtqHadARKcVGYo74\" rel=\"noopener\">Thailand</a>&nbsp;can do projects more efficiently than I can in Silicon Valley. South Korea’s tech ecosystem gives it a foundation to move even faster across multiple sectors. This emphasizes the long-term value for countries to become good at tech, because tech is now pervasive and affects all industries.</p><p>Korea has a very strong local software ecosystem. For example, the dominant search engine is not Google or Bing, but Naver (a Korean company). The dominant messaging system is not WhatsApp or WeChat, but KakaoTalk. With local tech giants Naver and Kakao offering email, mobile payment, cloud computing, ride sharing, and other services, the country has many sophisticated tech businesses. Additionally, SK hynix and Samsung are advanced semiconductor manufacturers. It also has a thriving entrepreneurship ecosystem, including Upstage, a language modeling startup, which taught a course with us on “<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/pretraining-llms/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QLV3stB3bwLzjBohF2UaWVwcaKjIvq6n7N_uFXp2PBA7QZzM5nYL7WtqHadARKcVGYo74\" rel=\"noopener\">Pretraining LLMs</a>.” Finally, the Korean institutions Seoul National University, which I visited last year, and KAIST have global reputations.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/09/unnamed--5--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"NG YEOL\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/09/unnamed--5--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/09/unnamed--5--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/09/unnamed--5--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Korea has a highly educated population, highly skilled software engineers, and a thriving set of software products.

The authors drew on earlier research into using SAEs to interpret neural networks.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>To see what a neural network layer knows about a given input token, you can feed it the token and study the embedding it generates. The difficulty with this approach is that the value at each index of the embedding may represent a tangle of concepts that are associated with many other values — too many other values to track.&nbsp;</li><li>Instead, an SAE can transform the embedding into one in which each index corresponds to a distinct concept. The SAE can learn to represent the embedding by the weighted sum of a much larger number of vectors than the number of values in the embedding. However, each weighted sum has only a small number of non-zero weights — in other words, each embedding is expressed as only a small-number, or sparse, subset of the SAE vectors. Since the number of learned SAE vectors is far greater than the number of values in the original embedding, any given vector is more likely to represent a distinct concept than any value in the original embedding.&nbsp;</li><li>The weights of this sum are interpretable: Each weight represents how strongly the corresponding concept is represented in the input. Given a token, the SAE’s first layer produces these weights.</li></ul><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors built over 400 SAEs, one for each layer of Gemma 2 2B and Gemma 2 9B. They fed Gemma 2 examples from its pretraining set and extracted the resulting embeddings at each layer. Given the resulting embeddings from a specific layer, an SAE learned to reconstruct each of them. An additional loss term minimized the number of non-zero outputs from the SAE’s first layer to help ensure that the SAE used only concepts related to the embedding. To interpret an embedding produced by the first layer of the SAE, the team labeled the embedding’s indices with their corresponding concepts. They used two main methods: manual and automatic.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Manual labeling: (1)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/google-deepmind/mishax?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8XjpMmSJNO9rhgAxXfOudBKD3Z2vm_VkDozlaIPeE3UCCo0iAaAlnKfIYjvfd5lxh_Yh23\" rel=\"noopener\">Insert the SAE</a>&nbsp;in the appropriate location in Gemma 2. (2) Prompt Gemma 2. (3) Select an index in the embedding from the SAE’s first layer. (4) Note which token(s) cause the value at that index to be high. (5) Label the index manually based on commonalities between the noted tokens.</li><li>Automatic labeling: This was similar to manual labeling, but GPT4o-mini labeled the indices based on commonalities between the noted tokens.&nbsp;</li><li>In addition to testing how Gemma 2 responds to particular input tokens, Gemma Scope can be used to steer the model; that is, to see how the model responds when it’s forced to generate text related (or unrelated) to a particular concept: (1) Search the index labels to determine which index corresponds to the concept in question. (2) Insert the corresponding SAE into Gemma 2 at the appropriate layer. (3) Prompt the modified Gemma 2 to generate text, adjusting the output of the SAE’s first layer at the index. Gemma 2’s text should reflect the changed value.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong>&nbsp;Earlier research into using SAEs to interpret neural networks was limited to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14860?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8XjpMmSJNO9rhgAxXfOudBKD3Z2vm_VkDozlaIPeE3UCCo0iAaAlnKfIYjvfd5lxh_Yh23\" rel=\"noopener\">interpreting a single layer</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08600?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8XjpMmSJNO9rhgAxXfOudBKD3Z2vm_VkDozlaIPeE3UCCo0iAaAlnKfIYjvfd5lxh_Yh23\" rel=\"noopener\">small network</a>.
