Rather than needing separate transformer networks to represent a reward function and an LLM, the authors show how, given an LLM, you can figure out the reward function (plus regularization term) that that LLM is best at maximizing. This collapses the two transformer networks into one. Thus, you now need to train only the LLM and no longer have to deal with a separately trained reward function. The DPO algorithm trains the LLM directly, so as to make the reward function (which is implicitly defined by the LLM) consistent with the human preferences.

In a lab, they tested each compound for its ability to inhibit growth of MRSA and its toxicity to human liver, skeletal muscle, and lung cells. Using the resulting data, they trained four ensembles of 20 graph neural networks each to classify compounds for (i) antibiotic properties, (ii) toxicity to the liver, (iii) toxicity to skeletal muscles, and (iv) toxicity to the lungs.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>They ran their four ensembles on 12 million compounds from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mcule.com/database/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--NdvYr0Fu7Gh2F34MUf_eZj8T0X0RgaluAJRvSnkTttkzl0Fk8qT4WTi4QTPFX0QSA1Ow2\" rel=\"noopener\">Mcule</a>&nbsp;database and a Broad Institute&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/felixjwong/antibioticsai?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--NdvYr0Fu7Gh2F34MUf_eZj8T0X0RgaluAJRvSnkTttkzl0Fk8qT4WTi4QTPFX0QSA1Ow2\" rel=\"noopener\">database</a>. They filtered out compounds with the lowest probability of being antibiotics and the highest probability of being toxic to humans, leaving 3,646 antibiotic, low-toxicity compounds.&nbsp;</li><li>Within these compounds, they found the minimal chemical structure responsible for the antibiotic properties. To do this, they removed atoms or rings of atoms from a molecule‚Äôs edges, predicted the probability that the modified molecule was an active antibiotic, and repeated these steps until the probability fell below a threshold. Compounds that share a chemical structure are likely to work in similar ways within the body, giving scientists a pathway to discover further compounds with similar benefits.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:&nbsp;</strong>Of the compounds predicted to be likely antibiotics and nontoxic, the authors lab-tested 241 that were not known to work against MRSA. Of those, 8.7 percent inhibited the bacterium‚Äôs growth. This exceeds the percentage of antibiotics in the training set (1.3 percent), suggesting that the authors‚Äô approach could be a useful first step in finding new antibiotics. The authors also tested 30 compounds predicted not to be antibiotics. None of them (0 percent) inhibited the bacterium‚Äôs growth ‚Äî further evidence that their approach could be a useful first step. Two of the compounds that inhibited MRSA share a similar and novel mechanism of action against bacteria and also inhibited other antibiotic-resistant infections in lab tests. One of them proved effective against MRSA infections in mice.</p><p><strong>Behind the news:&nbsp;</strong>Most antibiotics currently in use were discovered in the mid-20th century, a golden age of antibiotics, which brought many formerly deadly pathogens under control.

Subsequently, companies like DeepMind and OpenAI, which explicitly aim to develop AGI, propelled the idea into the mainstream.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The taxonomy categorizes systems as possessing narrow skills (not AGI) or general capabilities (AGI). It divides both narrow and general systems into five levels of performance beyond calculator-grade Level 0. It also includes a metric for degree of autonomy.</p><ul><li>Narrow systems perform one distinct task; they may perform at one of the five levels, but they are not AGI. General systems perform a range of tasks (which the authors don‚Äôt specify) that align with real-world activities of broad value to people, including but not limited to linguistic, mathematical, logical, spatial reasoning, social, learning, and creative tasks. Crucially, they can learn how to learn new skills and when to ask humans for more information. The authors classify general systems as AGI at various levels of performance.</li><li>Level 1 (‚Äúemerging‚Äù) matches or slightly exceeds unskilled humans. Levels 2 (‚Äúcompetent‚Äù), 3 (‚Äúexpert‚Äù), and 4 (‚Äúvirtuoso‚Äù) systems surpass the 50th, 90th and 99th percentiles of skilled human performance, respectively. Level 5 (‚Äúsuperhuman‚Äù or ‚Äúartificial superintelligence‚Äù) outperforms 100 percent of skilled humans.</li><li>Most current systems that perform at Level 2 or higher are narrow. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/protein-shapes-revealed/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--NdvYr0Fu7Gh2F34MUf_eZj8T0X0RgaluAJRvSnkTttkzl0Fk8qT4WTi4QTPFX0QSA1Ow2\" rel=\"noopener\">AlphaFold</a>, which finds the shapes of protein molecules, achieves Level 5 performance but only in a single task. On the other hand, the authors consider large language models like Bard, ChatGPT, and Lama 2 to be general systems at Level 1 (although their performance may achieve Level 2 in some tasks).&nbsp;</li><li>The authors‚Äô autonomy scale ranges from tools for which humans control the task while the system automates subtasks (the first level of autonomy) to agents that act independently (the fifth). Higher levels of performance can unlock higher levels of autonomy. For instance, Level 4 AGI may be necessary to enable fully autonomous vehicles that are safe and trustworthy.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:&nbsp;</strong>The authors‚Äô definition identifies some classes of tasks that contribute to generality, but it includes neither a list of tasks a system must perform to be considered general nor&nbsp;a method for selecting them. Rather, the authors call on the research community to develop a ‚Äúliving benchmark‚Äù for generality that includes a mechanism for adding novel tasks.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:&nbsp;</strong>AGI is one of the tech world‚Äôs hottest buzzwords, yet it has had no clear definition, and various organizations propose different definitions. This lack of specificity makes it hard to talk about related technology, regulation, and other topics. The authors‚Äô framework, on the other hand, supports a more nuanced discussion of the path toward AGI. And it may have high-stakes business implications: Under the terms of their partnership, OpenAI can withhold from Microsoft models that attain AGI. Applying the authors‚Äô taxonomy would make it harder for one of the parties to move the goalposts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We‚Äôre thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Defining AGI is tricky! For instance, OpenAI defines AGI as ‚Äúa highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.‚Äù This definition, had it been formulated in the early 1900s, when agriculture accounted for 70 percent of work globally, would have described the internal combustion engine.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/unnamed---2024-01-10T150942.421.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/unnamed---2024-01-10T150942.421.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"text-or-images-input-or-output\">Text or Images, Input or Output</h1><p>GPT-4V introduced a large multimodal model that generates text from images and, with help from DALL-E 3, generates images from text. However, OpenAI hasn‚Äôt fully explained how it built the system. A separate group of researchers described their own method.</p><p><strong>What's new:&nbsp;</strong>Jing Yu Koh, Daniel Fried, and Ruslan Salakhutdinov at Carnegie Mellon University proposed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17216?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--NdvYr0Fu7Gh2F34MUf_eZj8T0X0RgaluAJRvSnkTttkzl0Fk8qT4WTi4QTPFX0QSA1Ow2\" rel=\"noopener\">Generating Images with Large Language Models</a>&nbsp;(GILL), a training method that enables a large language model and a text-to-image generator to use both text and images as either input or output. Given text and/or image input, it decides whether to retrieve existing images or generate new ones.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;Models like CLIP and ImageBind map text and image inputs to a similar embedding space, so closely related text and images have similar embeddings. This approach enables a large multimodal model to process both data types. Text outputs, too, can be mapped to the same embedding space, so an image decoder, such as a diffusion model, can use them to produce images or an image retriever to retrieve images.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors used a pretrained&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01068?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--NdvYr0Fu7Gh2F34MUf_eZj8T0X0RgaluAJRvSnkTttkzl0Fk8qT4WTi4QTPFX0QSA1Ow2\" rel=\"noopener\">OPT</a>&nbsp;large language model,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929v2?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--NdvYr0Fu7Gh2F34MUf_eZj8T0X0RgaluAJRvSnkTttkzl0Fk8qT4WTi4QTPFX0QSA1Ow2\" rel=\"noopener\">ViT-L</a>&nbsp;image encoder (taken from CLIP), and pretrained Stable Diffusion text-to-image generator. The authors trained ViT-L to map its embeddings to those produced by OPT. They trained OPT to recognize prompts that request an image and enabled the system to either generate or retrieve images. Finally, a separate linear classifier learned whether to retrieve or generate images.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The authors froze the ViT-L, added a linear layer, and trained it as follows: Given an image, the ViT-L-plus-linear-layer produced an image embedding, as usual. Given the image embedding and the first part of the corresponding caption, OPT iteratively tried to predict the next word. The linear layer learned how to modify the embedding so OPT could complete the caption. This enabled OPT to take images as input.</li><li>They added 8 tokens to OPT‚Äôs vocabulary and trained the model to emit them at the end of every image caption ‚Äî a signal that an image should be either retrieved or generated. (Typically a single token is sufficient to denote the end of a caption. However, these tokens corresponded to embeddings that, later, would be used to generate an image, and the authors found that a single token was not sufficiently expressive.)</li><li>Then they enabled Stable Diffusion to produce an image when OPT generated the 8 new tokens. They trained a separate transformer to map OPT‚Äôs embeddings associated with the 8 tokens (that is, embeddings produced by the layer before the one that generated the tokens) to those produced by Stable Diffusion‚Äôs text encoder.</li><li>Next they enabled the system to retrieve images when OPT generated the 8 tokens. They added linear layers to ViT-L and OPT and trained them to map the ViT-L‚Äôs embeddings to the OPT embedding associated with the first token. Specifically, the linear layers learned to minimize the difference between their outputs.</li><li>The authors trained a linear classifier, given the 8 OPT embeddings associated with the tokens, to decide whether to retrieve or generate an image. To build the classifier‚Äôs training set, they selected captions from a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10789?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--NdvYr0Fu7Gh2F34MUf_eZj8T0X0RgaluAJRvSnkTttkzl0Fk8qT4WTi4QTPFX0QSA1Ow2\" rel=\"noopener\">collection</a>&nbsp;of diverse human-written prompts and, for each one, both generated an image and retrieved the most similar image from CC3M. 5 human judges selected the image that best matched the prompt. This process yielded 900 examples annotated according to whether the image was retrieved or generated.</li><li>At inference, OPT generated tokens and fed the associated embeddings directly to the classifier, which activated the pipeline for either the generation or retrieval.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03968?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--NdvYr0Fu7Gh2F34MUf_eZj8T0X0RgaluAJRvSnkTttkzl0Fk8qT4WTi4QTPFX0QSA1Ow2\" rel=\"noopener\">VIST</a>&nbsp;is a dataset of 20,000 visual stories, each of which comprises five captioned images. The authors evaluated GILL‚Äôs and Stable Diffusion‚Äôs abilities, given the final caption or all five captions, to generate the final image in each story based on CLIP similarity scores between generated and ground-truth images. Given one caption, GILL achieved 0.581 similarity and Stable Diffusion achieved 0.592 similarity. Given five captions, GILL achieved 0.612 similarity and Stable Diffusion scored 0.598 similarity, highlighting GILL‚Äôs ability to use the context afforded by more extensive input. It did even better (0.641 similarity) given both captions and images, which Stable Diffusion couldn‚Äôt handle. The authors also evaluated how well their system retrieved the correct last image from VIST given the 5 captions and the first 4 images. GILL retrieved the correct image 20.3 percent of the time, while their own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13823?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--NdvYr0Fu7Gh2F34MUf_eZj8T0X0RgaluAJRvSnkTttkzl0Fk8qT4WTi4QTPFX0QSA1Ow2\" rel=\"noopener\">FROMAGe</a>&nbsp;retrieved the correct image 18.2 percent of the time. In comparison, CLIP, given the 5 captions (without the images), retrieved the correct image 8.8 percent of the time.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Models that wed text and images are advancing rapidly. GILL and other recent models extend single-image input and/or output to any combination of images and text. This capability ‚Äî which GILL achieves by mapping embeddings of image and text to one another ‚Äî gives the models more context to generate more appropriate output.</p><p><strong>We‚Äôre thinking:</strong>&nbsp;The authors add an interesting twist: Rather than generating images, the system can choose to retrieve them.
