Switching costs for this layer are much higher than for the foundation model layer, since, if you’ve built an agent on one of these frameworks, it’s a lot of work to switch to a different one. Still, competition in the orchestration layer, as in the foundation model layer, seems intense.</p><p>Finally, there’s the application layer. Almost by definition, this layer has to do better financially than all the layers below. In fact, for investments at the lower layers to make financial sense, the applications had better generate even more revenue, so the application vendors can afford to pay providers of infrastructure, cloud computing, foundation models, and orchestration. (This is why my team AI Fund focuses primarily on AI application companies, as I discussed in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VX19pW89gp5FVr3xBM771f7cW99f7mw5p9Dd4MmLVSx3qgyTW7lCdLW6lZ3pkW4lGNMB41fP4hW7TmmYm1wMgb4W5sSL178vMZ32W8LlNvX5BZ73pW1ptNGF20q-7ZW6r0p5d4DgNg3W4cCCw25qSf7wW7LHHgz25yvk4W3w3FPg4dt5M7W1t-VrM2qTGjHW8y2clS8KRqxQN6g9wcLDwmPnW14vklb2HLGW1Vt7t9f7f6WKyV_ytyB7h6gX1Vf2TmL6cYwJBW1pC_rV4GTz7SW6g0LCl4vXf45W5L53C36_B8GHW97pncn9hHrH1W95lTbX7RMj2sW7jXZPr6P_rBFW6zYwf66WQkT7W1-n0zL4KqgJ1f58DcQP04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">talk</a>.)</p><p>Fortunately, because of the massive investments in foundation models, it’s now incredibly inexpensive to experiment and build prototypes in the applications layer! Over Thanksgiving holiday, I spent about one and a half days prototyping different generative AI applications, and my bill for OpenAI API calls came out to about $3. On my personal AWS account, which I use for prototyping and experimentation, my most recent monthly bill was $35.30. I find it amazing how much fun you can have on these platforms for a small number of dollars!</p><p>By building on widely available AI tools, AI Fund now budgets $55,000 to get to a working prototype. And while that is quite a lot of money, it’s far less than the billions companies are raising to develop foundation models.

(These figures don’t account for mitigations, which would improve the numbers, or ongoing manufacturing of earlier, less efficient technology, which would exacerbate them.)</li><li>The study assumed that servers typically would be discarded after three years. Upgrading servers more frequently, when improved hardware becomes available, would reduce overall server numbers because fewer servers would deliver greater processing power. However, because servers would be discarded more quickly, it could add a cumulative 1.2 million metric tons in the linear scenario or 2.3 million metric tons in the aggressive scenario, assuming no mitigation measures are taken.</li><li>U.S. trade restrictions on advanced chips are also likely to exacerbate the problem. They could push affected countries to rely on less-efficient hardware designs and thus require more new servers to reach a competitive processing capacity. This could increase total waste by up to 14 percent.</li><li>The authors explored several approaches to reducing e-waste. Repurposing equipment for non-AI applications and reusing critical components like GPUs and CPUs could cut e-waste by 42 percent. Improving the power efficiency of chips and optimizing AI models could reduce e-waste by 16 percent.</li><li>The most promising approach to reducing e-waste is to extend server lifespans. Adding one year to a server’s operational life could reduce e-waste by 62 percent.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;E-waste is a problem not only due to its sheer quantity. Server hardware contains materials that are both hazardous and valuable. Discarded servers contain toxic substances like lead and chromium that can find their way into food water supplies. They also contain valuable metals, such as gold, silver, and platinum, that could save the environmental and financial costs of producing more of them.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VX19pW89gp5FVr3xBM771f7cW99f7mw5p9Dd4MmLVT63qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3nBW43vymp79BvXNW1LyPf_74SpZ-W3XkzYf48WVwgN4V-Ln-CwRTXW8jd59L5jmyb5VkVkkP2M2G29W1yBdfy5DN6L1W4thWBX92NZ2FW3vkJXn1vz7W6W3C3R8612Gr8TMvHDxnpDGm4N4yvC479hGhmVT1yvP7VzvCWW29Tsng6p1btMW4nnw4v3-XRt1W1y94dZ7jXz3gW7JS5k_5JHpLcVc4dYW96xvwlVmzVPg4S8JPyW3mRtzz5-ZwJBW1-Q37N6CbKQ5W2_GLQb44XJZSW6VxHZN8Yt_H-Vq58MS5VLWB2W7hvvFy3qLv_GW6WP1ZJ1V-QWnW5t4YNQ2_V7NrW2BtzwD7Bs9M8f5NLk6004?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Proper</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VX19pW89gp5FVr3xBM771f7cW99f7mw5p9Dd4MmLVT63qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3kvW4xxzW52w3c74W6SbFt29fns75W5N_fnf7RkV37W6xtvM26LT3Q5W9glWWG5LrWb9W2CWMF_1Mlp-5W7jgHtk8CNZKVW1MWhH_1z1YCzW6krYvV4BmthQW2KkrsV31VfR7W8C85zg3hvBMyW55khBt2g02L-W7MXp2v16VCNyW49kpv37t2d5ZN3bPqlC8jsXKW1y2Qvt5Js2vmVbJmTL3ZLrsPVWXQGY6-yK-rW86X6-t91tsN_W4_fbHM7vRx_DW535rX74FvLsXVbmb8q68LdbMW1clhvH7NRYdTW1Dr6CF6t65RBW3xndWK2clpRlW6WGJpz4n9sWcW1WX7w52--QvKW4qjdCL7t9cMwf6plfYC04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">recycling</a>&nbsp;of these components could yield $14 billion to $28 billion, highlighting both the economic potential and the urgent need to develop and deploy advanced recycling technologies.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Humanity dumps over 2 billion metric tons of waste annually, so even comprehensive recycling and repurposing of AI hardware and other electronic devices would make only a small dent in the overall volume.

To this end, DPO’s loss function includes a regularization constraint that encourages the model to produce token probabilities similar to those it produced prior to fine-tuning. However, this causes the model to retain not only desired knowledge but also undesired knowledge that may lead it to produce an unwanted response. We can reduce the probability that it will draw on such undesired knowledge by changing the regularization constraint. The idea is to ensure similar token probabilities between (a) a model prior to fine-tuning, asked to behave harmlessly prior to receiving the harmful prompt and (b) the fine-tuned model, given a harmful prompt. This adjustment helps the fine-tuned model deliver outputs based on benign knowledge, along with the usual benefits of DPO.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors used E-DPO to further fine-tune&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VX19pW89gp5FVr3xBM771f7cW99f7mw5p9Dd4MmLVT63qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3pdW4tyYpQ5Yf1KwW1W9wKH5VWqTnW8BwsX-1Pyxg4W7VDSlL2G4mvfN2PXwCmr9lVNW2Z9bKY39djXRW2LTNWp5gkkwsW747gWm5B7hLDW6z24dx9876_tW8JgZLr7fgt2mW4j_yfZ5NV0h-W9btLTV1p2KP4W747BZR8vTCmDW6lp43h1rVx-zW2YtjPy6p98BpVLyjHm1tlZJCVvLD064l0x5nW8cRj1j7RHKt6W8MkMHc3LLPt2W6jLZ_d2xr3VxN6vT9TDJ4_4XW7r9Q9P2KwZRpW7MKbQx7byR5-W1W07WD6FsDY8W4tcJKp6Z_4GBN2H48bl6H3J_W7j9dlh2G6Gt1N7-TNbyT5YChf31B1zW04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Mistral-7b-sft-constitutional-ai</a>&nbsp;(which is aligned using the technique known as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VX19pW89gp5FVr3xBM771f7cW99f7mw5p9Dd4MmLVSd3qgyTW6N1vHY6lZ3kBVVpWF78vK4-XW4D3mFB74gCdTW5CP0mM29zXbDW4Jk4J_98ZNqnW2bVDXW8Kw-TcW32KnSx6Kr_gRW35VDs92v6szyW7ND0F_3K4ZyXVtns078FHjyfVN2-fs5fh4kJN3L6jX8195zPW5f8Fxh2FwbjxW1spqpG2bS8W1W6_3X903FKyMDW3gYv5321-rL1W7djRpP6bTV63W3YS_YL2Rqr5PW6lz-nR2K694-VclRNS2KGNcZW6NL5xV4JMnDxW4S3fGd3XVZLLW1CBwfv24h_pyf4SGzqd04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">constitutional AI</a>) on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VX19pW89gp5FVr3xBM771f7cW99f7mw5p9Dd4MmLVSR3qgyTW7Y8-PT6lZ3ndW2_QNJ76qBmg4VDxRT-8MWYmhW2r0f5k7pCcW8W17YYFT79hlvyW4lFFmK6JsSDKVGBnbk2b3nXWW8zYcVf4P2vP5W2MhXPN2b5Jk8W4F6dQQ86yxCJW93kWYg66w6vlN6JXHhdGnXgZW1W30TS14DRhCW5rn11g62T-yDW116Frd1KFhFrVcsV-55Qfy6BW55Pwty21R2ZzW5hwJT62D6wrmW5yW_lJ7KdP2sW4k5mQm4jZFVWV8MRtN5gxc7hW2PbsZC25MjncW1yr349972JnRW6J8kkM8DZyYFW4N1lY_5sKJBcW8yq4-X8RSCtSW65KqG-4MzkZYf8By1Ps04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">two</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VX19pW89gp5FVr3xBM771f7cW99f7mw5p9Dd4MmLVT63qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3mMW29VJj_1jm1hsW2vl_kt4sdD4GW2WqwvK3C3tpXW1_6_Z05pL25-W8-VmXp5F5CTvW50byxC1kYb1lW2V6f8K4S3Nx-W4G8vdq8JxPczVwRTbj6Mn-7CN5VtJLrv2ByvW7SyLw_8Z1l8YW2lRS_y3z6W2cW1LPDXT6cWYlsW2k0rdG77P7tFW230fqG6k_L43W5ShWl-5CSlFdW1-TQPg8DR7xKW5jyZ9q72-ZB6W2b3Kkd3F0httW7F4lWD3D3hLwW2BdFm3365808W3QdG9S5S_kS9W1vhyF63wffphW8J-l281Lt1nrW8C94xw5Ypbg4W7l6Rhp71x9wVW8zqmR470HG8rW7SsClM8kL1M9dy6nfl04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">datasets</a>&nbsp;in which each example consists of a prompt, a preferred response, and an objectionable response.</p><ul><li>The authors prompted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VX19pW89gp5FVr3xBM771f7cW99f7mw5p9Dd4MmLVSx3qgyTW7lCdLW6lZ3mRN4Z5w5-F9wbvW41RNB155bnZdW50j70Y2PxVZWN6dd30FfB7b_W2m3b9K56p-b4V_9b6K7HJ2fGW90rbR911BcZdW4nSYBV3pGzFWN1WN6Wvh3C2BW7ZnrFb1qFfBSW76fgQ67HSGbBW3_9Vf83qdvk7W3h37SC1TJ0DhW1hHpt78qpXTrW7bYf1N6hf4syW7hvtLL48rnznW593NY565NBNdN56rKLFLnrvkW7WlsTj271V4MW81-SgG39GQQhW2X5V7-8ptVVpW6RJdsW7qB7NHV7HC312Nz0wsN2kGQrmPqjBNf5qrTH804?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">GPT-3.5 Turbo</a>&nbsp;to classify harmful prompts in the datasets.</li><li>They fine-tuned the model according to DPO but, when the input was classified as harmful, they computed the regularization constraint differently.
