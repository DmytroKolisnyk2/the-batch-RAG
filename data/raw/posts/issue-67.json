Take speech recognition. If humans transcribing an audio clip were to label the same speech disfluency “um” (a U.S. version) 70 percent of the time and “erm” (a UK variation) 30 percent of the time, then HLP would be low. Two randomly chosen labelers would agree only 58 percent of the time (0.72 + 0.33). An AI model could gain a statistical advantage by picking “um” all of the time, which would be consistent with 70 percent of the time with the human-supplied label. Thus, the AI would beat HLP without being more accurate in a way that matters.</em></p><p><em>Labeling training data consistently is particularly important for small data problems. Innovations like data synthesis using <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">generative adversarial networks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/data-augmentation-AYzbX?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">data augmentation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/transfer-learning-4THzO?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">transfer learning</a>, and self-supervision expand the possibilities for small data. But when I’m trying to train a neural network on 1,000 examples, the first thing I do is make sure they’re labeled consistently.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen20Shot202020-11-2520at2010.36.4120AM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Labeling training data charts\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><em>Let’s continue with last week’s example of determining if a scratch is significant based on its length. If the labels are noisy — say, different labelers used different thresholds for labeling a scratch as significant (the left-hand graph in the image above)¸— an algorithm will need a large number of examples to determine the optimal threshold. But if the data were clean — if all the labelers agree on the length that causes the label to switch from 0 to 1 (the right-hand graph) — the optimal threshold is clear.</em></p><p><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Learning theory</a> affirms that the number of examples needed is significantly lower when the data is consistently labeled. In the simple example above, the error decreases on the order of {1 / √ m} in the case on the left, and {1/m} in the case on the right, where m is the training set size. Thus, error decreases much faster when the labels are consistent, and the algorithm needs many fewer examples to do well.</em></p><p><em>Clean labels are generally helpful. You might be better able to get away with noisy labels when you have 1 million examples, since the algorithm can average over them. And it’s certainly much harder to revise 1 million labels than 1,000. But clean labels are worthwhile for all machine learning problems and particularly important if you’re working with small data.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h2 id=\"news\"><strong>News</strong></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-gif-maker2039.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Graphs with data related to AI use cases\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"washington-wrestles-with-ai\">Washington Wrestles with AI</h3><p>The U.S. government’s effort to take advantage of AI have not lived up to its promise, according to a new report.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Implementations of machine learning systems by federal agencies are “uneven at best, and problematic and perhaps dangerous at worst,” <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2020-09/HAI_PromisePeril_Sep20.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> authors of a <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/education/only-at-sls/law-policy-lab/practicums-2018-2019/administering-by-algorithm-artificial-intelligence-in-the-regulatory-state/acus-report-for-administering-by-algorithm-artificial-intelligence-in-the-regulatory-state/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io#slsnav-report\" rel=\"noopener\">survey</a> by the Administrative Conference of the United States, Stanford Law School, and New York University School of Law.<br><br><strong>What they found:</strong> Less than half of civilian federal agencies surveyed used some form of AI, and about 7 percent of them accounted for the lion’s share of AI implementations evaluated. The most common implementations were in law enforcement, health care, and financial regulations. Examples include the Border Patrol’s use of face recognition for its <a href=\"https://www.biometrics.cbp.gov/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Biometric Entry/Exit</a> program and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/insights-into-sec-risk-assessment-programs.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Corporate Issuer Risk Assessment</a>, which helps regulators detect faults in companies’ financial reports.</p><ul><li>Only 12 percent of implementations used deep learning. The rest used approaches such as logistic regression with structured data (which the authors deemed lower sophistication) or random forests with hyperparameter tuning (which they judged medium sophistication).</li><li>Government agencies are legally required to explain their decisions, such as why a person was denied benefits. But algorithms often reach conclusions for reasons that are not explainable, making it difficult to appeal.</li><li>Around half of the systems evaluated were developed by outside contractors. The authors recommend greater investment in in-house talent because it’s more likely to tailor systems appropriately to government uses.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> The authors relied primarily on publicly available information, which may not contain sufficient technical perspective for such analysis. In addition, the survey period ended in August 2019, so the report excludes systems deployed since then.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> AI could help government agencies operate more effectively and efficiently, but this report shows that they have a long way to go to fulfill that vision.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Governments have an obligation to audit AI systems for performance, fairness, and compliance before rolling them out. Yet most agencies (and, for that matter, most corporations) don’t have the capability to assess these factors. We need tools that that enable a variety of stakeholders to define clear standards and assess  whether they’ve been met, so we can spot problems, mitigate risks, and build trust in automated systems.  We hope that companies such as <a href=\"https://www.credo.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Credo AI</a> (which is backed by Andrew Ng’s AI Fund) can help.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-gif-maker2029.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Example of a crowd size estimate\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"better-crowd-counts\">Better Crowd Counts</h3><p>Did a million people attend the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Man_March?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Million Man March</a>? Estimates of the crowd size gathered at a given place and time can have significant political implications — and practical ones, too, as they can help public safety experts deploy resources for public health or crowd control. A new method improves on previous crowd-counting approaches with a novel way to compare predictions with hand-labeled training data.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13077?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">DM-Count</a> trains neural networks to count crowd size using <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/optimal-transport-a-hidden-gem-that-empowers-todays-machine-learning-2609bbf67e59?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">optimal transport</a> in the cost function. Optimal transport is a measure of difference between two distributions. In this case, the first distribution is the network’s prediction of people’s locations in a training example, and the second is the ground-truth locations. The method was developed by Boyu Wang and colleagues at Stony Brook University.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Training datasets for crowd-counting models typically mark each person in an image with a single-pixel label. Training a network to match such labels is difficult, because tiny discrepancies in a label’s location count as errors. Previous approaches managed this problem by replacing the pixels with blobs, but choosing the right blob size is difficult given the wide range of sizes of people and parts of people in an image. Optimal transport gave the authors a way to compare the density of single-pixel predictions with that of single-pixel labels. Armed with this metric, they could measure the deformation necessary to match a matrix of predictions to the labels and apply a cost accordingly.<br><br><strong>How it works: </strong>DM-Count accepts a picture of a crowd and places pixels where it sees people. Ideally, it would place one per person with 100 percent certainty, but in practice it spreads that certainty over a few pixels. In training, it learns to match those values to the training data using a loss function that combines three terms:</p><ul><li>Optimal transport loss helps the model learn to minimize differences between the distributions of predictions and labels. It’s computationally expensive to calculate, so DM-Count approximates it using the <a href=\"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4927-sinkhorn-distances-lightspeed-computation-of-optimal-transport.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Sinkhorn algorithm</a>.</li><li>The Sinkhorn algorithm is less accurate in image areas that contain fewer people, so DM-Count applies an additional penalty based on the number of places in a predicted matrix that didn’t match the corresponding pixel-labels.</li><li>A third loss term works to minimize the difference between the predicted and labeled counts.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors built a modified [VGG-19]https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556 as detailed in this <a href=\"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Ma_Bayesian_Loss_for_Crowd_Count_Estimation_With_Point_Supervision_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">paper</a> and used DM-Count to train it on datasets including <a href=\"https://gjy3035.github.io/NWPU-Crowd-Sample-Code/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">NWPU</a>, which the authors considered the most challenging crowd-counting dataset.
