One example: Copyright law as it relates to generative AI is a mess! That many businesses are operating without a clear understanding of what is and isn’t legal slows down innovation. The world needs updated laws that enable AI users and developers to move forward without risking lawsuits.</em></p><p><em>Legal challenges to generative AI are on the rise, as you can read below, and the outcomes are by no means clear. I’m seeing this uncertainty slow down the adoption of generative AI in big companies, which are more sensitive to the risk of lawsuits (as opposed to startups, whose survival is often uncertain enough that they may have much higher tolerance for the risk of a lawsuit a few years hence).</em></p><p><em>Meanwhile, regulators worldwide are focusing on how to mitigate AI harm. This is an important topic, but I hope they will put equal effort into crafting copyright rules that would enable AI to benefit more people more quickly.</em></p><p><em>Here are some questions that remain unresolved in most countries:</em></p><ul><li><em>Is it okay for a generative AI company to train its models on data <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/the-story-of-laion-the-dataset-behind-stable-diffusion/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">scraped</a> from the open internet? Access to most proprietary data online is governed by terms of service, but what rules should apply when a developer accesses data from the open internet and has not entered into an explicit agreement with the website operator? </em></li><li><em>Having trained on freely available data, is it okay for a generative AI company to stop others from training on its system’s output? </em></li><li><em>If a generative AI company’s system generates material that is similar to existing material, is it liable for copyright infringement? How can we evaluate the allowable degree of similarity?</em></li><li><em>Research has <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/spotting-similarities-between-generated-images-and-data/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">shown</a> that image generators sometimes copy their training data. While the vast majority of generated content appears to be novel, if a customer (say, a media company) uses a third-party generative AI service (such as a cloud provider’s API) to create content, reproduces it, and the content subsequently turns out to infringe a copyright, who is responsible: the customer or the cloud provider? </em></li><li><em>Is automatically generated material protected by copyright, and if so, <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/us-will-not-recognize-copyrights-for-ai-generated-images/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">who owns it</a>? What if two users use the same generative AI model and end up creating similar content — will the one who went first own the copyright?</em></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/unnamed--36--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/unnamed--36--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/unnamed--36--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/unnamed--36--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Here’s my view:</em></p><ul><li><em>I believe humanity is better off with permissive sharing of information. If a person can freely access and learn from information on the internet, I’d like to see AI systems allowed to do the same, and I believe this will benefit society. (Japan <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/japan-ai-data-laws-explained/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">permits</a> this explicitly. Interestingly, it even permits use of information that is not available on the open internet.)</em></li><li><em>Many generative AI companies have terms of service that prevent users from using output from their models to train other models. It seems unfair and anti-competitive to train your system on others’ data and then stop others from training their models on your system’s output.</em></li><li><em>In the U.S., “<a href=\"https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics/fair-use.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-98Z0EEpyu-3WG5zBBBGen28QtQATna5cMllWRxO7eBqQ-IMiqGxR4sZnxp2nFzIAc70bQt\" rel=\"noopener\">fair use</a>” is poorly defined. As a teacher who has had to figure out what I am and am not allowed to use in a class, I’ve long disliked the ambiguity of fair use, but generative AI makes this problem even more acute. Until now, our primary source of content has been humans, who generate content slowly, so we’ve tolerated laws that are so ambiguous that they often require a case-by-case analysis to determine if a use is fair. Now that we can automatically generate huge amounts of content, it’s time to come up with clearer criteria for what is fair. For example, if we can algorithmically determine whether generated content overlaps by a certain threshold with content in the training data, and if this is the standard for fair use, then it would unleash companies to innovate while still meeting a societally accepted standard of fairness.</em></li></ul><p><em>If it proves too difficult to come up with an unambiguous definition of fair use, it would be useful to have “safe harbor” laws: As long as you followed certain practices in generating media, what you did would be considered non-infringing. This would be another way to clarify things for users and generative AI companies.</em></p><p><em>The tone among regulators in many countries is to seek to slow down AI’s harms. While that is important, I hope we see an equal amount of effort put into accelerating AI’s benefits. Sorting out how we should change copyright law would be a good step. Beyond that, we need to craft regulations that clarify not just what’s not okay to do — but also what is explicitly okay to do.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/unnamed--37-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1120\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/unnamed--37-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/unnamed--37-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/unnamed--37-.png 1120w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"copyright-owners-take-ai-to-court\">Copyright Owners Take AI to Court</h1><p>AI models that generate text, images, and other types of media are increasingly under attack by owners of copyrights to material included in their training data.</p><p><strong>What’s happening: </strong>Writers and artists filed a new spate of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/16/ai-programs-training-lawsuits-fair-use/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-98Z0EEpyu-3WG5zBBBGen28QtQATna5cMllWRxO7eBqQ-IMiqGxR4sZnxp2nFzIAc70bQt\" rel=\"noopener\">lawsuits</a> alleging that AI companies including Alphabet, Meta, and OpenAI violated their copyrights by training generative models on their works without permission.

However, the technology’s growing ability to produce creative works, and do so in the styles of specific artists and writers, has focused attention on such use and raised legitimate questions about whether it’s fair. This much is clear: The latest advances in machine learning have depended on free access to large quantities of data, much of it scraped from the open internet.

That means opportunities for practitioners at both hot ventures and me-too companies that seek to cultivate similar markets. The startup scene is volatile — as the difference between this year’s and <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/standout-startups/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">last year’s AI100</a> demonstrates — but each crop of new firms yields a few long-term winners.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Startup trends are informative, but the options for building a career in AI are far broader. Established companies increasingly recognize their need for AI talent, and fresh research opens new applications.

New work eliminates the need for optimizer hyperparameters.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Luke Metz, James Harrison, and colleagues at Google devised <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09760?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-98Z0EEpyu-3WG5zBBBGen28QtQATna5cMllWRxO7eBqQ-IMiqGxR4sZnxp2nFzIAc70bQt\" rel=\"noopener\">VeLO</a>, a system designed to act as a fully tuned optimizer. It uses a neural network to compute the target network’s updates.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Machine learning engineers typically find the best values of optimizer hyperparameters such as learning rate, learning rate schedule, and weight decay by trial and error. This can be cumbersome, since it requires training the target network repeatedly using different values. In the proposed method, a different neural network takes the target network’s gradients, weights, and current training step and outputs its weight updates — no hyperparameters needed.</p><p><strong>How it works: </strong>At every time step in the target network’s training, an LSTM generated the weights of a vanilla neural network, which we’ll call the optimizer network. The optimizer network, in turn, updated the target network. The LSTM learned to generate the optimizer network’s weights via <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03864?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-98Z0EEpyu-3WG5zBBBGen28QtQATna5cMllWRxO7eBqQ-IMiqGxR4sZnxp2nFzIAc70bQt\" rel=\"noopener\">evolution</a> — iteratively generating a large number of similar LSTMs with random differences, averaging them based on which ones worked best, generating new LSTMs similar to the average, and so on — rather than backpropagation.</p><ul><li>The authors randomly generated many (on the order of 100,000) target neural networks of various architectures — vanilla neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, transformers, and so on — to be trained on tasks that spanned image classification and text generation.</li><li>Given an LSTM (initially with random weights), they copied and randomly modified its weights, generating an LSTM for each target network. Each LSTM generated the weights of a vanilla neural network based on statistics of the target network. These statistics included the mean and variance of its weights, exponential moving averages of the gradients over training, fraction of completed training steps, and training loss value.</li><li>The authors trained each target network for a fixed number of steps using its optimizer network. The optimizer network took the target network’s gradients, weights, and current training step and updated each weight, one by one. Its goal was to minimize the loss function for the task at hand. Completed training yielded pairs of (LSTM, loss value).</li><li>They generated a new LSTM by taking a weighted average (the smaller the loss, the heavier the weighting) of each weight across all LSTMs across all tasks. The authors took the new LSTM and repeated the process: They copied and randomly modified the LSTM, generated new optimizer networks, used them to train new target networks, updated the LSTM, and so on.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors evaluated VeLO using a dataset scaled to require no more than one hour to train on a single GPU on any of 83 tasks. They applied the method to a new set of randomly generated neural network architectures. On all tasks, VeLO trained networks faster than <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-98Z0EEpyu-3WG5zBBBGen28QtQATna5cMllWRxO7eBqQ-IMiqGxR4sZnxp2nFzIAc70bQt\" rel=\"noopener\">Adam</a> tuned to find the best learning rate — four times faster on half of the tasks. It also reached a lower loss than Adam on five out of six <a href=\"https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/main/RULES.md?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-98Z0EEpyu-3WG5zBBBGen28QtQATna5cMllWRxO7eBqQ-IMiqGxR4sZnxp2nFzIAc70bQt\" rel=\"noopener\">MLCommons tasks</a>, which included image classification, speech recognition, text translation, and graph classification tasks.</p><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> The authors’ approach underperformed exactly where optimizers are costliest to hand-tune, such as with models larger than 500 million parameters and those that required more than 200,000 training steps. The authors hypothesized that VeLO fails to generalize to large models and long training runs because they didn’t train it on networks that large or over that many steps.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> VeLO accelerates model development in two ways: It eliminates the need to test hyperparameter values and speeds up the optimization itself. Compared to other optimizers, it took advantage of a wider variety of statistics about the target network’s training from moment to moment. That enabled it to compute updates that moved models closer to a good solution to the task at hand.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> VeLO appears to have overfit to the size of the tasks the authors chose. Comparatively simple algorithms like Adam appear to be more robust to a wider variety of networks. We look forward to VeLO-like algorithms that perform well on architectures that are larger and require more training steps.</p><p><strong>We’re not thinking:</strong> Now neural networks are taking optimizers’ jobs!</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p> <strong>OECD finds that AI imperils a quarter of jobs</strong><br>A survey conducted by the international organization on AI’s impact on employment revealed that three out of five workers expressed concerns about the potential loss of their job to AI within the next decade, among other findings.
