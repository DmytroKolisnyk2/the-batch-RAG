Similarly, the countries of the world need to compel large AI companies to disclose their activities in detail.</em></p><p><em>While the details of any required disclosure need to be worked out, I can imagine, for example, requiring large companies to analyze, or allow independent organizations to analyze, how much content of different flavors (such as pro/con various social issues) they deliver to different subsets of their audience (such as users in a particular region or demographic group). By presenting aggregate results, this can be done in a way that preserves individual privacy.

The authors analyzed each summary for evidence that it had been generated by ChatGPT. The analysis relied on two methods:</p><ul><li>The authors fine-tuned <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-base?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--4HuGHnUVkVru3wLgAlnAOWa7cwfy1WYgqS16TakjYTqk0mS8aOQxpr7PQoaI8aGTx9hte\" rel=\"noopener\">e5-base</a> to differentiate between summaries written by humans prior to the experiment and summaries generated by the authors, who prompted ChatGPT with the Mechanical Turk instructions.</li><li>They also tracked the keystrokes of Mechanical Turk workers. Matching keystrokes and submissions counted as evidence that the writing was human-written. On the other hand, keystrokes that indicated copying and pasting indicated that submissions were generated.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors analyzed 46 summaries written by 44 workers. The classifier found 21 summaries that showed 50 percent or greater likelihood of having been written by ChatGPT and 15 summaries that showed at least a 98 percent or greater likelihood. 41 of the summaries involved copying and pasting.</p><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> The researchers studied 46 summaries, a rather small sample.

For example, it’s hard to imagine a language model trained only on the output of ChatGPT surpassing ChatGPT, whereas one trained on human data might. The lack of transparency with respect to which data comes from humans and which comes from machines presents a huge challenge for AI practitioners.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/unnamed--21-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/unnamed--21-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/unnamed--21-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/unnamed--21-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"where-is-meta%E2%80%99s-generative-play\">Where Is Meta’s Generative Play?</h1><p>While Microsoft and Google scramble to supercharge their businesses with text generation, Meta has yet to launch a flagship generative AI service.

Moreover, some observers worry that Schumer’s deliberative approach could slow down legislative efforts that are already underway. <br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Thoughtful AI regulations must strike a delicate balance between encouraging innovation and protecting the public. It’s imperative that lawmakers — few of whom have a background in technology or science — understand the nuances.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> U.S. politics are increasingly divided. Bipartisan listening sessions on AI may serve a dual goal of educating lawmakers and uniting them around a shared vision.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/FINETUNINGv2--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/FINETUNINGv2--1-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"finer-tuning\">Finer Tuning</h1><p>Fine-tuning a neural network typically involves retraining every layer on new data. But research shows that networks may perform better when fine-tuning modifies only a subset of layers.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Yoonho Lee, Annie S. Chen, and colleagues at Stanford demonstrated <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11466?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--4HuGHnUVkVru3wLgAlnAOWa7cwfy1WYgqS16TakjYTqk0mS8aOQxpr7PQoaI8aGTx9hte\" rel=\"noopener\">surgical fine-tuning</a>, a method that chooses specific layers to modify depending on how the fine-tuning dataset differs from the pretraining data.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Earlier layers in a neural network learn to produce representations of fundamental features of the input, such as edges and shapes in an image, while later layers <a href=\"https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--4HuGHnUVkVru3wLgAlnAOWa7cwfy1WYgqS16TakjYTqk0mS8aOQxpr7PQoaI8aGTx9hte\" rel=\"noopener\">combine</a> these features in a way that contributes to predicting a desired output, such as the image’s label. During fine-tuning, if the new images differ from the pretraining images in appearance, only earlier layers require modification. If the new images resemble the pretraining images but differ in their labels, only later layers require modification. Fine-tuning the appropriate layers updates a network effectively by prioritizing the weights most relevant to the new data.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors fine-tuned a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--4HuGHnUVkVru3wLgAlnAOWa7cwfy1WYgqS16TakjYTqk0mS8aOQxpr7PQoaI8aGTx9hte\" rel=\"noopener\">ResNet-26</a> model pretrained on <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--4HuGHnUVkVru3wLgAlnAOWa7cwfy1WYgqS16TakjYTqk0mS8aOQxpr7PQoaI8aGTx9hte\" rel=\"noopener\">CIFAR-10</a> using manual and automated approaches.</p><ul><li>In the manual approach, the authors fine-tuned each layer individually, producing a new network each time. They identified the best layers to fine-tune by comparing the performance of each network.</li><li>In the automated approach, they calculated the gradients for each layer. They divided the gradients by the magnitude of the layer’s weights to obtain relative gradients. They normalized the relative gradients across each layer at the beginning of fine-tuning and periodically throughout. This effectively ranked the layers from lowest to highest relative gradient on a scale from 0 to 1.</li><li>During training, they assigned the learning rate for each layer according to the product of its normalized relative gradient (its score between 0 and 1) and a standard learning rate. This way, layers with the largest relative gradient would have the largest learning rate, while layers with the smallest relative gradient would have an effective learning rate of 0 and remain unchanged by fine-tuning.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Evaluated on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12261?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--4HuGHnUVkVru3wLgAlnAOWa7cwfy1WYgqS16TakjYTqk0mS8aOQxpr7PQoaI8aGTx9hte\" rel=\"noopener\">CIFAR-C</a>, a version of the CFAR dataset deliberately corrupted by noise, the authors’ manual method classified images with 82.8 percent accuracy, while fine-tuning the whole network achieved 79.9 percent accuracy. The automated approach achieved 81.4 percent.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The authors drew on knowledge of how the neural networks process input to propose an efficient fine-tuning method. Better understanding of how a network <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--4HuGHnUVkVru3wLgAlnAOWa7cwfy1WYgqS16TakjYTqk0mS8aOQxpr7PQoaI8aGTx9hte\" rel=\"noopener\">extracts</a> features could yield further ways to improve machine learning models.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> On datasets more complex than CIFAR-C, it can be hard to judge the difference between a pretraining dataset and a fine-tuning dataset. This may make the authors’ automated approach more valuable, even though it didn’t yield the best results.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong>Disney+ TV series faces backlash over use of AI</strong><br>Marvel series <em>Secret Invasion</em> used an AI-generated title card in its intro.
