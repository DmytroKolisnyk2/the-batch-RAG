We’ve evaluated a lot of AI startup ideas. There’s no one-size-fits-all template for building businesses, but we’ve fine-tuned our recipes. In this and subsequent letters, I’ll share some of the patterns I’ve seen.</em></p><p><em>AI businesses <a href=\"https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-developing-ai-products-is-different-from-traditional-software/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">differ</a> from traditional software startups in important ways. For instance, technical feasibility isn’t always clear, product specification is complex, and data is necessary to train and test the system.</em></p><p><em>One important factor is whether a startup focuses on hard tech (sometimes called deep tech). A hard-tech company:</em></p><ul><li><em>Relies on advanced, better-performing technology that significantly improves the customer experience or business efficiency.</em></li><li><em>Requires highly skilled teams that are capable of building materially better technology.</em></li></ul><p><em>In determining whether a business requires hard tech, the key factor is whether best-in-class technology will make the difference between success and failure.</em></p><p><em>For instance, speech recognition based on deep learning was hard tech 10 years ago. Only a handful of teams were able to build highly accurate systems and put them into production at scale. Higher accuracy greatly improved the user experience, and that drove adoption. Competitors had a hard time catching up.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-04-at-12-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Hot air balloons and spaceship departing\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1199\" height=\"674\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-04-at-12-1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-04-at-12-1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-04-at-12-1.jpg 1199w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Another example is online advertising. Building a system that selects the most relevant ad within hundreds of milliseconds is very challenging. Showing better ads results in more revenue per page view. More revenue not only improves the bottom line but makes it possible to afford higher costs to acquire users (say, by paying a maker of web browsers to feature one search engine over another). This, in turn, makes it harder for rivals to compete.</em></p><p><em>What once was hard tech often becomes easier to build over time. For example, as speech recognition became commoditized, more teams were able to build useful systems. When this happens, having the best tech is much less critical to success. Other factors can have a bigger impact such as superior product design, a skilled sales team, bundling with other services, or an efficient supply chain.</em></p><p><em>I enjoy working on hard-tech businesses — and many AI Fund companies fit that description — because the quality of the technology really matters. A hard-tech company has an incentive to build the best possible team, because the finest team can significantly outperform competitors.</em></p><p><em>Of course, AI businesses that aren’t hard-tech can be very meaningful, too. There are many, many exciting applications, across all industries, yet to be built using established technology. We need developers going at these problems, too.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/05/Virus-Animation.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Bat and viruses symbols\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/05/Virus-Animation.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"predicting-the-next-pandemic\">Predicting the Next Pandemic</h1><p>Odds are that the next mass contagion will jump to humans from animals.

The architectures included k-nearest neighbors and a gradient boosted machine. The training data included a database of bat traits and a graph dataset of 710 animal species and viruses they carry. The system identified 400 bat species as carriers of pathogens that might infect humans.</li><li>Last year, researchers at the University of Glasgow trained a gradient boosted machine to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34582436/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">identify</a> animal viruses with high risk of infecting humans. The model considered the proportion of human-infecting variants in a given virus family, features of carrier species, and features of viral genomes. It identified 313 potentially dangerous animal viruses.</li><li>Those studies build on 2015 <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00245-7/fulltext?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">work</a> at Princeton and University of Georgia, where researchers <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1501598112?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">trained</a> a gradient boosted machine to classify whether a given rodent species is likely to carry pathogens that can infect humans. The data included a dataset that detailed 86 traits of rodent species and another that cataloged rodent-borne viruses known to infect humans. The model pointed to 58 species previously not considered threatening that may harbor dangerous diseases and 159 likely to carry multiple diseases that previously were believed to carry just one.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> The AI community isn’t just working to predict future pandemics, it’s also fighting the current one.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/crowdsourcing-against-coronavirus/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Covid Moonshot</a>, a global collaboration of over 150 scientists and machine learning engineers, designed multiple antiviral drugs to target the virus that causes Covid-19.

Using AI to identify viruses likely to cross the species barrier could give scientists a jump on whatever comes next. Medical researchers could develop vaccines and treatments ahead of time, and officials could mitigate the spread of potentially dangerous disease by managing animal populations and limiting trade in disease-carrying species.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Whether an animal virus can infect a human is one question.

An authorization <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Baidu-gets-green-light-for-driverless-robotaxi-service-in-Beijing?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">issued</a> last November had allowed the companies to operate in the same area with safety drivers.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The robotaxis are restricted to a 23 square-mile zone in Beijing’s southeastern suburbs, home to roughly 300,000 residents.

Permission to do it without safety drivers likely will represent a huge cost saving if the government relaxes the requirement to carry a supervisor.

New work enabled ViT and its variants to outperform other architectures with less training data.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Seung Hoon Lee, Seunghyun Lee, and Byung Cheol Song at Inha University <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13492?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">proposed</a> two tweaks to transformer-based vision architectures.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> ViT and its variants divide input images into smaller patches, generates a representation — that is, a token — of each patch, and applies self-attention to track the relationships between each pair of tokens. Dividing an image can obscure the relationships between its parts, so adding a margin of overlap around each patch can help the attention layers learn these relationships. Moreover, an attention layer may fail to distinguish sufficiently between strong and weak relationships among patches, which interferes with learning. For instance, it may weight the relationship between a background patch and a foreground patch only slightly lower than that between two foreground patches. Enabling the attention layers to learn to adjust such values should boost the trained model’s performance.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Starting with a collection of transformer-based image classifiers, the authors built modified versions that implemented two novel techniques. The models included ViT, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11986?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">T2T</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17239?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">CaiT</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16302?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">PiT</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Swin</a>. They were trained on datasets of 50,000 to 100,000 images (<a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">CIFAR-10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">CIFAR-100</a>, <a href=\"http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2015/pdfs/yle_project.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Tiny-ImageNet</a>, and <a href=\"http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">SVHN</a>) as well as the standard <a href=\"https://www.image-net.org/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">ImageNet</a> training set of 1,281 million images.</p><ul><li>The first modification (shifted patch tokenization, or SPT) created overlap between adjacent patches. Given an image, the model produced four copies, then shifted each copy diagonally in a different direction by half the length of a patch. It divided the image into patches and concatenated the corresponding patches. Given the concatenated patches, it created a representation.</li><li>The second modification (locality self-attention, or LSA) altered the self-attention mechanism. Given the matrix computed by the dot-product between the patches (typically the first step in self-attention), the model masked the diagonal. That is, it set to negative infinity every value that represented the strength of relationships between corresponding patches, causing the model to ignore relationships between them. It also rescaled the matrix using a learned parameter, so the model increased the weight of the closest relationships while decreasing the others.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The alterations boosted the top-1 accuracy of all models on all datasets. They improved the accuracy of PiT and CaiT by 4.01 percent and 3.43 percent on CIFAR100, and the accuracy of ViT and Swin by 4.00 percent and 4.08 percent on Tiny-ImageNet. They improved the ImageNet accuracy of ViT, PiT, and Swin by 1.60 percent, 1.44 percent, and 1.06 percent respectively.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> The authors also applied their alterations to the convolutional architectures <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">ResNet</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">EfficientNet</a>. Only  CaiT and Swin surpassed them on CIFAR100  and SVHN. Only CaiT beat them on Tiny-ImageNet. No transformer beat ResNet’s performance on CIFAR10, though all the modified transformers except ViT beat ResNet on the same task.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The authors’ approach makes transformers more practical for visual tasks in which training data is limited.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Transformers are making great strides in computer vision.
