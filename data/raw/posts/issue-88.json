But this criterion may not reflect a system's utility in the real world, where numerous videos may be highly relevant to the search terms. New work aims to solve this problem.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers at the University of Bristol led by Michael Wray propose a new benchmark, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10095v1?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_aJF51DWRL7S8hGmfAxCDqTyEaDJ-rlU74Tl_5IT49tBOxMpJWMa8hcmDMYL0Zw8hWKJE0\" rel=\"noopener\">Semantic Similarity Video Retrieval</a>  (SVR), that evaluates video retrieval systems by their ability to rank many similar videos. They also built a system that performed well on it.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> To evaluate a video retrieval system based on how similar the top-ranked videos are to an input description, the evaluation process needs a ground-truth measure of similarity between descriptions and videos. There isn’t an automatic way to compare a description to a video, but there are several ways to compare a description to other descriptions. The authors assessed the similarity between existing descriptions to approximate ground-truth similarity between descriptions and videos. This enabled them to train their system to rank the similarity of input text to a variety of videos, and to evaluate the quality of its search results.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors generated separate representations for captions and videos and honed the similarity of matching descriptions and videos. Given a description, the system learned to rank clips whose video representation best matched that of the input (and vice-versa). They trained and tested it on <a href=\"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/Xu_MSR-VTT_A_Large_CVPR_2016_paper.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_aJF51DWRL7S8hGmfAxCDqTyEaDJ-rlU74Tl_5IT49tBOxMpJWMa8hcmDMYL0Zw8hWKJE0\" rel=\"noopener\">videos with descriptions</a> from movies, news, how-tos, and other sources.</p><ul><li>The authors calculated similarity between each description and every other description using <a href=\"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W05-0909/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_aJF51DWRL7S8hGmfAxCDqTyEaDJ-rlU74Tl_5IT49tBOxMpJWMa8hcmDMYL0Zw8hWKJE0\" rel=\"noopener\">METEOR</a>.
