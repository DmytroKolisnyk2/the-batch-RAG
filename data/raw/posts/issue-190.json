I encourage you to think of it as a general-purpose technology (GPT, not to be confused with the other GPT: generative pretrained transformer). Like deep learning — and electricity — generative AI is useful not just for a single application, but for a multitude of applications that span many corners of the economy. And, like the rise of deep learning that started 10 to 15 years ago, there’s important work to be done in coming years to identify use cases and build specific applications.</em></p><p><em>Generative AI (Gen AI) offers huge opportunities for AI engineers to build applications that make the world a better place. Will it be used to deliver educational coaching, help people with their writing and artwork, automate customer support, teach people how to cook, generate special effects in movies, or dispense medical advice? Yes, all of the above and many more applications besides!

The AI Fund team understands this general-purpose technology — but not global shipping, real estate, security, mental health, and many other industries that AI can be applied to. Thus we’ve found it critical to partner with subject-matter experts who understand the use cases in these areas. If you have an idea for applying AI, working with a subject matter expert — if you aren’t already one yourself — can make a huge difference in your success.</em></p><p><em>Moreover, I don’t think any single company can simultaneously tackle such a wide range of applications that span diverse industries. The world needs many startups to build useful applications across all these sectors.</em></p><p><em>It should go without saying that, in applying Gen AI, it’s crucial to move forward with a keen sense of responsibility and ethics.

Of those who had encountered information about AI’s ability to generate news articles, 16 percent said it was a major advance.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news: </strong>A January 2023 <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_021523/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-97vgI6y3CtI67sW5lVxOMPCZ1JXOZUgJimvT8lKqWH_wWsdGNEvux7T5FckUUd5-jf9Lii\" rel=\"noopener\">survey</a> by Monmouth University corroborates some of Pew’s findings. 35 percent of that poll’s 805 respondents had heard a lot about recent AI developments. 72 percent believed that news outlets would eventually publish AI-penned news articles. 78 percent thought this would be a bad thing.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>As AI matures, it becomes more important to take the public’s temperature on various applications. The resulting insights can guide developers in building products that are likely to meet with public approval.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>The respondents’ familiarity with a given application did not correlate with their acceptance of it. While we should be responsive to what people want, part of our job is to show people the way to a future they may not yet envision — all the more reason for AI builders to <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/someone-elses-cool-ai-project-doesnt-make-your-project-less-valuable/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">follow your interests</a> rather than the latest AI fads.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/unnamed--51-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Transformer-based system simulating simulate the Atari game &quot;Pong&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/unnamed--51-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"efficient-reinforcement-learning\">Efficient Reinforcement Learning</h1><p>Both transformers and reinforcement learning models are notoriously data-hungry. They may be less so when they work together.</p><p><strong>What's new: </strong>Vincent Micheli and colleagues at the University of Geneva trained a transformer-based system to simulate Atari games using a small amount of gameplay. Then they used the simulation to train a reinforcement learning agent, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00588?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-97vgI6y3CtI67sW5lVxOMPCZ1JXOZUgJimvT8lKqWH_wWsdGNEvux7T5FckUUd5-jf9Lii\" rel=\"noopener\">IRIS</a>, to exceed human performance in several games.</p><p><strong>Key insight: </strong>A transformer excels at predicting the next item in a sequence. Given the output of a video game, it can learn to estimate a reward for the player’s button press and predict tokens that represent the next video frame. Given these tokens, an autoencoder can learn to reconstruct the frame. Together, the transformer and autoencoder form a game simulator that can help a reinforcement learning agent learn how to play.</p><p><strong>How it works: </strong>For each of the 26 games in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4708?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-97vgI6y3CtI67sW5lVxOMPCZ1JXOZUgJimvT8lKqWH_wWsdGNEvux7T5FckUUd5-jf9Lii\" rel=\"noopener\">Atari 100k</a>, in a repeating cycle, (i) a reinforcement learning agent played for a short time without learning, (ii) a system learned from the game frames and agent’s button presses to simulate the game, and (iii) the agent learned from the simulation. The total amount of gameplay lasted roughly two hours — 100,000 frames and associated button presses — per game.</p><ul><li>The agent, which comprises a convolutional neural network followed by an LSTM, played the game for 200 frames. It received a frame and responded by pressing a button (randomly at first). It received no rewards and thus didn’t learn during gameplay.</li><li>Given a frame, an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-97vgI6y3CtI67sW5lVxOMPCZ1JXOZUgJimvT8lKqWH_wWsdGNEvux7T5FckUUd5-jf9Lii\" rel=\"noopener\">autoencoder</a> learned to encode it into a set of tokens and reconstruct it from the tokens.</li><li>Given tokens that represented recent frames and button presses, a transformer learned to estimate the reward for the last button press and generate tokens that represented the next frame. The transformer also learned to estimate whether the current frame would end the game.</li><li>Given the tokens for the next frame, the autoencoder generated the image. Given the image, the agent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02193?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-97vgI6y3CtI67sW5lVxOMPCZ1JXOZUgJimvT8lKqWH_wWsdGNEvux7T5FckUUd5-jf9Lii\" rel=\"noopener\">learned</a> to choose the button press that would maximize its reward.</li><li>The cycle repeated: The agent played the game, generating new frames and button presses to train the autoencoder and transformer. In turn, the autoencoder’s and transformer’s outputs trained the agent.</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>The authors’ agent beat the average human score in 10 games including Pong. It also beat state-of-the-art approaches that include lookahead search (in which an agent chooses button presses based on predicted frames in addition to previous frames) in six games and those without lookahead search in 13 games. It worked best with games that don’t involve sudden changes in the gaming environment; for instance, when a player moves to a different level.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Transformers have been used in reinforcement learning, but as agents, not as world models. In this work, a transformer acted as a world model — it learned to simulate a game or environment — in a relatively sample-efficient way (100,000 examples). A similar approach could lead to high-performance, sample-efficient simulators.</p><p><strong>We're thinking:</strong> The initial success of Atari-playing models was exciting partly because the reinforcement learning approach didn’t require building or using a model of the game. A model-based reinforcement learning approach to solving Atari is a surprising turn of events.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11408?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Research</a>:<strong> New tools explore bias in image generators</strong><br>Tools developed by Hugging Face and Leipzig University help users to detect social biases in three widely used AI image generators.
