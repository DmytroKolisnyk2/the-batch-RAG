In fact, nearly 17 years ago, I co-organized a NeurIPS <a href=\"https://www-cs.stanford.edu/groups/nips05-AI-Workshop/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lBL-0X7iKNh27uM3DiHG0nqveBX4JZ3nU9jF1sGt0EDA29LSG4eY3wWKir62HmnRDEljp\" rel=\"noopener\">workshop</a> on building human-level AI.</em></p><p><em>Artificial general intelligence (AGI) was a controversial topic back then and remains so today. But recent progress in self-supervised learning, which learns from unlabeled data, makes me nostalgic for the time when a larger percentage of deep learning researchers — even though it was a very small group — focused on algorithms that might play a role in mimicking how the human brain learns.</em></p><p><em>Obviously, AGI would have extraordinary value. At the same time, it’s a highly technical topic, which makes it challenging for laypeople — and even experts — to judge which approaches are feasible and worthwhile. Over the years, the combination of AGI’s immense potential value and technical complexity has tempted entrepreneurs to start businesses on the argument that, if they have even a 1 percent chance of success, they could be very valuable. Around a decade ago, this led to a huge amount of hype around AGI, generated sometimes by entrepreneurs promoting their companies and sometimes by business titans who bought into the hype.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-09-at-3-2.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"What people think artificial general intelligence will look like\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1199\" height=\"674\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-09-at-3-2.webp 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-09-at-3-2.webp 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-09-at-3-2.webp 1199w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Of course, AGI doesn’t exist yet and there’s no telling if or when it will. The volume of hype around it has made many respectable scientists shy away from talking about it. I’ve seen this in other disciplines as well. For decades, overoptimistic hopes that cold fusion would soon generate cheap, unlimited, safe electricity have been dashed repeatedly so that, for a time, even responsible scientists risked their reputations by talking about it.</em></p><p><em>The hype around AGI has died down compared to a few years ago. That makes me glad, because it creates a better environment for doing the work required to make progress toward it.

A new machine-learning model helped a quadruped robot coordinate its sensors and actuators.</p><p><strong>What's new:</strong> Chieko Sarah Imai and colleagues at University of California devised a reinforcement learning method, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14549?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lBL-0X7iKNh27uM3DiHG0nqveBX4JZ3nU9jF1sGt0EDA29LSG4eY3wWKir62HmnRDEljp\" rel=\"noopener\">Multi-Modal Delay Randomization</a> (MMDR), that approximates real-world latency in a simulated training environment, enabling engineers to compensate for it.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Most robot simulations wait for the machine to take an action after a change in its surroundings. But in the real world, it takes time for a sensor to read the environment, a neural network to compute the action, and motors to execute the action — and by that time, the environment has already shifted again. Simulating the latency of sensors that track position and movement during training <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10332?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lBL-0X7iKNh27uM3DiHG0nqveBX4JZ3nU9jF1sGt0EDA29LSG4eY3wWKir62HmnRDEljp\" rel=\"noopener\">helps</a> a model to learn to adjust accordingly, but that doesn’t account for lags due to reading and processing visual sensors. Simulating a separate latency for vision should address this issue.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors trained their system to compute optimal angles for a simulated robot's joints using the reinforcement learning algorithm <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lBL-0X7iKNh27uM3DiHG0nqveBX4JZ3nU9jF1sGt0EDA29LSG4eY3wWKir62HmnRDEljp\" rel=\"noopener\">proximal policy optimization</a>.

They split the buffer into quarters and randomly selected a frame from each part to simulate variable latency in real-world depth perception.</li><li>Similarly, they buffered position and movement sensor readings, for example, the angles of the robot’s joints. For fine variation over the latency, they chose two adjacent readings at random and interpolated between them.</li><li>Selected frames of depth information went to a convolutional neural network, and position and movement sensor readings went to a vanilla neural network. The system concatenated the representations from both networks and passed them to another vanilla neural network, which generated target angles for each joint.</li><li>The reward function encouraged the virtual robot to keep moving forward and not to fall while minimizing the virtual motors’ energy cost.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors tested a <a href=\"https://www.unitree.com/products/a1/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lBL-0X7iKNh27uM3DiHG0nqveBX4JZ3nU9jF1sGt0EDA29LSG4eY3wWKir62HmnRDEljp\" rel=\"noopener\">Unitree A1</a> robot in the real world, comparing MMDR with alternatives they call No-Delay and Frame-Extract. No-Delay used only the four most recent frames as input. Frame-Extract was similar to MMDR but used the initial frames from each of the buffered sequences. MMDR was consistently best in terms of steps traveled through a variety of terrain. For example, in nine forest trials, the robot using MMDR moved an average of 992.5 steps versus 733.8 steps for No-Delay and 572.4 steps for Frame-Extract.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Robots in the wild often face different mechanical and environmental conditions than a simulation can reproduce. To build autonomous machines that work in the real world, it’s critical to account for all kinds of latency in the system.</p><p><strong>We're thinking:</strong> Roboticists and mechanical engineers who work with physical robots have been accounting for various control latencies for decades. But much of the recent activity in reinforcement learning has involved simulated environments. We’re glad to see researchers working to bridge the sim-to-real gap and address the challenges of working with physical robots.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/03/Algorithms-for-the-Aged.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Pictures of senior citizens \" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/03/Algorithms-for-the-Aged.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"algorithms-for-the-aged\">Algorithms for the Aged</h1><p>The United Nations office that promotes international public health advised AI practitioners to pay closer attention to elders.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> A <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240040793?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lBL-0X7iKNh27uM3DiHG0nqveBX4JZ3nU9jF1sGt0EDA29LSG4eY3wWKir62HmnRDEljp\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> by the World Health Organization (WHO) warns that elders may not receive the full benefit of AI in healthcare.
