AI system development will move faster if we can shift from being model-centric to being data-centric. You can watch a video of the event <a href=\"https://youtu.be/06-AZXmwHjo?utm_source=thebatch&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=mlops-talk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>. </em><br><br><em>Unlike traditional software, which is powered by code, AI systems are built using both code (including models and algorithms) and data:</em><br><em>AI systems = Code + Data</em><br><br><em>When a system isn’t performing well, many teams instinctually try to improve the Code. But for many practical applications, it’s more effective instead to focus on improving the Data.</em><br><br><em>Progress in machine learning has been driven for decades by efforts to improve performance on benchmark datasets, in which researchers hold the Data fixed while improving the Code. But for many applications — especially ones where the dataset size is modest (&lt;10,000 examples) — teams will make faster progress by focusing instead on making sure the dataset is good:</em></p><ul><li><em>Is the definition of y given x clear and unambiguous? For example, do different data labelers draw bounding boxes consistently? Do speech transcriptionists label ambiguous audio consistently, for instance, writing “um, yes please” rather than “um … yes please”?</em></li><li><em>Does the input distribution x sufficiently cover the important cases?</em></li><li><em>Does the data incorporate timely feedback from the production system, so we can track concept and data drift?</em></li></ul><p><em>It’s a common joke that 80 percent of machine learning is actually data cleaning, as though that were a lesser task. My view is that if 80 percent of our work is data preparation, then ensuring data quality is the important work of a machine learning team.</em><br><br><em>Rather than counting on engineers to chance upon the best way to improve a dataset, I hope we can develop MLOps tools that help make building AI systems, including building high-quality datasets, more repeatable and systematic. MLOps is a nascent field, and different people define it differently. But I think the most important organizing principle of MLOps teams and tools should be to ensure the consistent and high-quality flow of data throughout all stages of a project. This will help many projects go more smoothly. </em><br><br><em>I have much more to say on this topic, so check out my talk <a href=\"https://youtu.be/06-AZXmwHjo?utm_source=thebatch&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=mlops-talk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.

Convolutional neural networks excel at finding and using spatial patterns to perform tasks such as image generation. Thus, a convolutional neural network can use the spatial relationships between active neurons in a brain scan to reconstruct the corresponding visual image. <br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors used a picture-to-picture generative adversarial network (GAN) to try to produce an image of what a person was looking at based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): 3D scans that depict blood oxygenation in the brain, which indicates neuron activity. They trained the GAN on <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/687681v1.full?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Doctor Who fMRI</a>, a collection of video frames from 30 episodes of <em>Doctor Who</em> and corresponding fMRIs captured as an individual watched the show.</p><ul><li>The authors converted each 3D scan into 2D images, each of which represented distinct sections of the brain, using a neuroscientific device known as a <a href=\"https://ccneuro.org/2019/proceedings/0000717.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">receptive field estimator</a> .</li><li>They trained the GAN’s discriminator to classify whether an image came from <em>Doctor Who</em> or the GAN’s generator. They trained the generator with a loss function that encouraged it to translate the 2D images of neuron activity into an image that would fool the discriminator.</li><li>The generator used two additional loss terms. The first term aimed to minimize the difference between the pixel values of a video frame and its generated counterpart. The second term aimed to minimize the difference between representations, extracted by <br>a pretrained <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VGG-16</a>, of a video frame and its generated counterpart.</li><li>The generator used a convolutional architecture inspired by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">U-Net</a> in which residual connections passed the first layer’s output to the last layer, second layer’s output to the penultimate layer, and so on.

That method occasionally produced blank spots. The authors addressed that shortcoming by translating descriptive words into object labels (rather than simply matching words with labels) and distinguishing foreground from background.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The Local Narratives dataset provides an inherent correspondence between every word in a description and a mouse trace over an image. TReCS uses this correspondence to translate words into labels of objects that populate a scene. The authors trained the system on the portion of Localized Narratives that used images in <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_48?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">COCO</a> and tested it on the portion that used <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00982?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Open Images</a>.</p><ul><li>Given a description, a BERT model assigned an object label to each word in the description.

Then they fine-tuned the pretrained BERT to, say, attach the label “snow” to each of the words in “skiing on the snow.”</li><li>For each label assigned by BERT, the system chose a mask from a similar image (say, a photo taken in a snowy setting). The authors trained a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.15020?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cross-modal dual encoder</a> to maximize the similarity between a description and the associated image, and to minimize the similarity between that description and other images. On inference, given a description, the authors used the resulting vectors to select the five most similar training images.</li><li>The system used these five images differently for foreground and background classes (an attribute noted in the mask dataset). For foreground classes such as “person,” it retrieved the masks with the same label and chose the one whose shape best matched the label’s corresponding mouse trace. For background classes such as “snow,” it chose all of the masks from the image whose masks best matched the labels and combined shape of the corresponding mouse traces.</li><li>The authors arranged the masks on a blank canvas in the locations indicated by the mouse traces. They positioned first background and then foreground masks, reversing the order in which they were described. This put the first-mentioned object in front.</li><li>A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.06809.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">generative adversarial network</a> learned to generate realistic images from the assembled masks.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Five judges compared TReCS’ output with that of <a href=\"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Xu_AttnGAN_Fine-Grained_Text_CVPR_2018_paper.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AttnGAN</a>, a state-of-the-art, text-to-image generator that did not have access to mouse traces.

They rated both images well aligned 8.9 percent of the time and neither image 4.8 percent of the time.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The authors took advantage of familiar techniques and datasets to extract high-level visual concepts and fill in the details in a convincing way. Their method uncannily synthesized complex scenes from verbal descriptions (though the featured example, a skier standing on a snowfield with trees in the background, lacks the railing and mountain mentioned in the description). <br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Stock photo companies may want to invest in systems like this.
