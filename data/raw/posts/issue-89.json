If you’re working in a domain you’re familiar with, you may have a sense based on experience or from the literature. But when you’re working on a novel application, it’s hard to tell. In this circumstance, I find it useful to ask not how much data to collect but how much time to spend collecting data.</em><br><br><em>For instance, I’ve worked on automatic speech recognition, so I have a sense of how much data is needed to build this kind of system: 100 hours for a rudimentary one, 1,000 hours for a basic one, 10,000 hours for a very good one, and perhaps 100,000-plus hours for an absolutely cutting-edge system. But if you were to give me a new application to work on, I might find it difficult to guess whether we need 10 or 10,000 examples.</em><br><br><em>When starting a project, it’s useful to flip the question around.

How many days should you spend collecting data before training and error analysis?

Such systems would have to demonstrate proof of safety, be trained using high-quality data, and come with detailed documentation. Chatbots and other generative systems would have to let users know they were interacting with a machine.</li><li>For lower-risk applications, the proposal calls for voluntary codes of conduct around issues like environmental sustainability, accessibility for the disabled, and diversity among technology developers.</li><li>Companies that violate the rules could pay fines of up to 6 percent of their annual revenue.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Some business-minded critics said these rules would <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-facial-recognition-face-curbs-in-new-eu-proposal-11619000520?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9xUeD6U_wAKL6en9xHUken81dFKPUNdDhIbCHtOgdJrAjnOuAZYH5bbNyQvsXzzjv3OX6b\">hinder innovation</a>.

To perform well, a debater must quickly prepare arguments supported by evidence, address competing arguments, and organize statements logically — a set of tasks too diverse for an end-to-end system. Instead, the team built a pipeline of independent components, each a complex system in its own right.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> Project Debater receives a motion to argue in favor of or against.
