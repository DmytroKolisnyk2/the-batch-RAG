For large companies, too, the speed with which an innovation team is able to iterate has a huge impact on its odds of success. Generative AI makes it possible to quickly prototype AI capabilities. AI capabilities that used to take months can sometimes be built in days or hours by simply prompting a large language model. I find this speed exciting and have been thinking about how to help startups and large companies alike go faster.</p><p>I’ve been obsessed with speedy execution for a long time. When working on a project, I am loath to take two weeks to do something that I could do in one week. The price of moving at that pace is not that we take one week longer (which might be okay) but that we’re 2x slower (which is not)!</p><p>When building an AI-powered product, there are many steps in designing, building, shipping, and scaling the product that are distinct from building the AI capability, and our ability to execute these other steps has not sped up as much as the AI part. But the speed with which we can prototype AI creates significant pressure to speed up these other steps, too. If it took 6 months to collect data, train a supervised learning algorithm, and deploy the model to the cloud, it might be okay to take 2 months to get user feedback. But if it takes a week to build a prototype, waiting 2 months for feedback seems intolerably slow!</p><p>I’d like to focus on one key step of building applications: getting user feedback. A core part of the iterative workflow of designing and building a product (popularized by Eric Ries in his book&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QQJ-Lsgi3w6F1pfzQUc206gK2TX5eRUf4zuVjUuEdpU5l6odgKkVQzcOzfcNOuyMkobOG\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Lean Startup</em></a>) is to build a prototype (or MVP, minimum viable product), get user feedback on it, and to use that feedback to drive improvements. The faster you can move through this loop — which may require many iterations — the faster you can design a product that fits the market. This is why AI Fund, a venture studio that I lead, uses many fast, scrappy tactics to get feedback.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/10/unnamed--23-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Two cheetahs in a savannah, with one saying ‘Move fast and be responsible!’ in a speech bubble.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/unnamed--23-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/unnamed--23-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/10/unnamed--23-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>For B2C (business to consumer) offerings, here is a menu of some options for getting customer feedback:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Ask 3 friends or team members to look at the product and let you know what they think (this might take ~0.5 days).</li><li>Ask 10 friends or team members to take a look (~2 days).</li><li>Send it to 100 trusted/volunteer alpha testers (~1 week?).</li><li>Send it to 1,000 users to get qualitative or quantitative feedback (~2 weeks?).</li><li>Incorporate it into an existing product to get feedback (1 to 2 months?).</li><li>Roll it out to a large user base of an existing product and do rigorous A/B testing.</li></ol><p>As we go down this list, we get (probably) more accurate feedback, but the time needed to get that feedback increases significantly. Also, the tactics at the top of the list create basically no risk, and thus it’s safe to repeatedly call on them, even with preliminary ideas and prototypes. Another advantage of the tactics further up the list is that we get more qualitative feedback (for example, do users seem confused? Are they telling us they really need one additional feature?), which sparks better ideas for how to change our product than an A/B test, which tells us with rigor whether a particular implementation works but is less likely to point us in new directions to try. I recommend using the fast feedback tactics first. As we exhaust the options for learning quickly, we can try the slower tactics.</p><p>With these tactics, scrappy startup leaders and innovation-team leaders in large companies can go faster and have a much higher chance of success.</p><p>The mantra “move fast and break things” got a bad reputation because, well, it broke things. Unfortunately, some have interpreted this to mean we should not move fast, but I disagree. A better mantra is “move fast and be responsible.” There are many ways to prototype and test quickly without shipping a product that can cause significant harm. In fact, prototyping and testing/auditing quickly before launching to a large audience is a good way to identify and mitigate potential problems.</p><p>There are numerous AI opportunities ahead, and our tools are getting better and better to pursue them at speed, which I find exhilarating!</p><p>Keep learning!</p><p>Andrew</p><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/practical-multi-ai-agents-and-advanced-use-cases-with-crewai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/10/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-10-22T102129.757.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Promo banner for &quot;Practical Multi AI Agents and Advanced Use Cases with crewAI&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-10-22T102129.757.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-10-22T102129.757.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-10-22T102129.757.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/10/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-10-22T102129.757.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Build advanced, multi-agent systems for project planning, sales pipelines, customer support analysis, and content creation in our new course with crewAI!

The authors modified the typical process of removing noise from image embeddings in two ways: spatially and temporally.</p><ul><li>Spatially: Given an embedding of eight video frames, SD3 Medium starts by removing noise on a heavily downsampled (very small) version of the embedding. After a number of noise-removal steps, the system increases the embedding size and adds further noise. It repeats these steps until SD3 is finished removing noise from the full-size embedding.</li><li>Temporally: When it’s removing noise from an embedding of eight frames, SD3 Medium receives downsampled versions of the previous embeddings it has generated. These embeddings start at the size of the current embedding and get progressively smaller for earlier frames. (They’re progressively smaller because the further they are from the current embedding, the less closely related they are to the current embedding.)</li><li>At inference: Given a prompt, T5 and CLIP produce text embeddings. Given the text embeddings, an embedding of pure noise, and previously denoised embeddings, SD3 Medium removes noise. Given the denoised embeddings from SD3 Medium, the autoencoder’s decoder turns them into a video.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors compared their model to other open and closed models using VBench, a suite of benchmarks for comparing the quality of generated video. They also conducted a survey of human preferences. On VBench, their model outperformed other open models but slightly underperformed the best proprietary models, such as Kling. Human evaluators rated their model as superior to Open-Sora 1.2 for esthetics, motion, and adherence to prompts, and better than Kling for esthetics and adherence to prompts (but not motion). Furthermore, running on an Nvidia A100 GPU, their model took 20,700 hours to learn to generate videos up to 241 frames long. Running on a faster Nvidia H100 GPU, Open-Sora 1.2 took 37,800 hours to learn to generate 97 frames.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Video generation is a burgeoning field that consumes enormous amounts of processing.
