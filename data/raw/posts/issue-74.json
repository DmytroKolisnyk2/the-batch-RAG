The company published a <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/papers/Learning_Transferable_Visual_Models_From_Natural_Language.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">paper that describes CLIP</a> in detail; a similar Dall-E paper is forthcoming.<br><br><strong>How they work:</strong> Both models were trained on text-image pairs.</p><ul><li>DALL·E (whose name honors both <a href=\"https://thedali.org/about-the-museum/timeline/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Salvador Dalí</a> and Pixar’s <a href=\"https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/walle?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">WALL·E</a>) is a decoder-only transformer model. OpenAI trained it on images with text captions taken from the internet.  Given a sequence of tokens that represent a text and/or image, it predicts the next token. Then it predicts the next token given its previous prediction and all previous tokens.</li><li>This allows DALL·E to generate images from a wide range of text prompts and to generate fanciful images that aren’t represented in its training data, such as “an armchair in the shape of an avocado.”</li><li>CLIP uses a text encoder (a modified transformer) and an image encoder (a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">vision transformer</a>) trained on 400 million image-text pairs drawn from the internet. Using contrastive loss function adopted from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00747?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ConVIRT</a>, it learned to predict which of nearly 33,000 text snippets would match an image.</li><li>Since CLIP can predict which text best matches an image among any number of texts, it can perform zero-shot classification in any image classification task. At inference, CLIP is given a list of all potential classes in the form of “a photo of a {object}.” Then, fed an image, it returns the most likely class from the list.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Neither model is immune to goofs. Asked to produce a pentagonal clock, for instance, DALL·E rendered some timepieces with six or seven sides. CLIP, meanwhile, has trouble counting objects in an image and differentiating subclasses like car brands or flower species.<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> The new models build on earlier research at the intersection of words and images. A seminal 2016 <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05396?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">paper</a> from the University of Michigan and Max Planck Institute for Informatics showed that GANs could generate images from text embeddings.

Judging by the examples OpenAI has published so far, however, DALL·E seems to produce more accurate depictions and to navigate a startling variety of prompts with flair.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> As OpenAI chief scientist (and former post-doc in Andrew’s lab) Ilya Sutskever recently <a href=\"https://blog.deeplearning.ai/blog/the-batch-new-year-wishes-from-fei-fei-li-harry-shum-ayanna-howard-ilya-sutskever-matthew-mattina?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> in <em>The Batch</em>, humans understand concepts not only through words but through visual images.

A new approach could save time.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Juntang Zhuang and colleagues at Yale, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and University of Central Florida proposed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07468?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">AdaBelief</a>, a more efficient variation on the popular <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Adam</a> optimizer.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> The popular optimization methods of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam sometimes take small steps, requiring more time to reach their destination, when they could take larger ones. Given a small learning rate and a point in a large, steep area of a loss function’s landscape, SGD takes small steps until the slope becomes steeper, while Adam’s steps become smaller as it progresses. In both scenarios, an ideal optimizer would predict that the slope is long and take larger steps.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> AdaBelief adjusts its step size depending on the difference between the current gradient and the average of previous gradients.</p><ul><li>Like Adam, AdaBelief moves along a function step by step and calculates an exponential moving average of the gradient, assigning exponentially smaller weights to previous gradients. Also like Adam, at each step, a steeper average gradient generally calls for a larger step size.</li><li>Unlike Adam, AdaBelief treats the weighted average as a prediction of the gradient at the next step. If the difference between the prediction and the actual gradient is small, the function’s steepness probably isn’t changing much, and AdaBelief takes a relatively larger step. Conversely, if the difference is large, the landscape is changing, and AdaBelief decreases the step size.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors provide <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7KkG3n9bER6YmMLrKJ5wocjlvP7aWoOu&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">videos</a> showing that, in experiments on functions with known minimums, AdaBelief was faster than both Adam and SGD with momentum (as shown above). To demonstrate their method’s accuracy, they compared AdaBelief to SGD, Adam, and other adaptive optimizers on tasks including image classification, image generation, and language modeling. AdaBelief basically matched SGD’s accuracy and exceeded that of all other adaptive optimizers. For instance, on <a href=\"http://www.image-net.org/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ImageNet</a>, AdaBelief increased a <a href=\"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ResNet18</a>’s highest top-1 accuracy, or accuracy of its best prediction, to 70.08 percent, on par with SGD’s 70.23 percent and 2 percent better than the best adaptive optimizers.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Faster optimization means faster training, and that means more time to experiment with different models.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> The authors’ video demonstrations suggest that AdaBelief could be a valuable alternative to Adam. However, they don’t supply any numbers that would make for a precise speed comparison.

The researchers trained it using 25,000 copies of the five forms used most frequently by area hospitals.

Using high-performance architectures for the various components of a world model ought to improve the entire system — in this case, by reducing its size.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Following the typical world models approach, the authors trained separate neural networks to generate a representation of the environment (the representation model), predict how actions would affect the environment (the dynamics model), and choose the action that will bring the greatest reward (the policy model).</p><ul><li>For the representation model, the authors used a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">vector quantized variational autoencoder</a> (VQ-VAE) that’s smaller than the autoencoder in SimPLe.

(After training, the decoder is no longer needed.)</li><li>For the dynamics model, they used a convolutional LSTM that takes as input the encoder’s output.

SimPLe uses 74 million parameters, while their method uses 12 million during training and 3 million during inference. Nonetheless, their method’s mean scores over five training runs beat SimPLe in five out of six games when given 100,000 observations.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Although the authors’ method beat SimPLe on average, SimPLe racked up higher scores in four out of six games.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Smaller models consume less energy, require less memory, and execute faster than larger ones, enabling machine learning engineers to perform more experiments in less time.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> World models are young enough that something as simple as changing the components used can make a big difference. This suggests that plenty of opportunity remains to improve existing models.</p>","comment_id":"60bfdeab274d5b003b10642a","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/06/Screen20Shot202021-01-1320at2010.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2021-06-08T14:18:35.000-07:00","updated_at":"2022-10-06T12:02:59.000-07:00","published_at":"2021-01-13T12:00:00.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"Last Wednesday, the U.S. Capitol building was overrun by insurrectionists at the moment when members of Congress were certifying the results of a national election.
