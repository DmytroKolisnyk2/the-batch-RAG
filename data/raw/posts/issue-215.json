Can it do the job of a computer programmer?</em></p><p><em>Typically, we think of computer programmers as writing code, but actually they perform a variety of tasks.

Automating the writing of documentation may be much easier, so an AI team building tools for programmers might consider that too. However, if consulting to clarify the intent behind a program turns out to be hard for AI, we might assign that a lower priority.</em></p><p><em>Another example: Can AI do the job of a radiologist?

If you’re carrying out this type of analysis, you’re likely to get better results if you capture an accurate understanding of tasks carried out by employees of the specific company you’re working with.</em></p><p><em>An unfortunate side effect of this approach is that it tends to find human tasks to automate rather than creative applications that no one is working on. Brynjolfsson laments that this leads to the Turing Trap whereby we tend to use AI to do human work rather than come up with tasks no human is doing. But sometimes, if we can do something that humans do but do it 10,000x faster and cheaper, it changes the nature of the business. For example, email automated the task of transmitting messages. But it didn’t make the postal system cheaper; instead it changed what and how frequently we communicate. Web search automated the task of finding articles. Not only did this make librarians more effective, it also changed how we access information. So even if AI tackles a task that humans perform, it could still lead to revolutionary change for a business.</em></p><p><em>Many jobs in which some tasks can be automated aren’t likely to go away. Instead, AI will augment human labor while humans continue to focus on the things they do better. However, jobs that are mostly or fully automatable may disappear, putting people out of work. In such cases, as a society, we have a duty to take care of the people whose livelihoods are affected, to make sure they have a safety net and an opportunity to reskill and keep contributing. Meanwhile, lowering the cost of delivering certain services is bound to increase the demand for some jobs, just as the invention of the car led to a huge explosion in the number of driving jobs. In this way, AI will create many jobs as well as destroy some.</em></p><p><em>Some programmers worry that generative AI will automate their jobs. However, programming involves enough different tasks, some of which are hard to automate, that I find it very unlikely that AI will automate these jobs anytime soon. Pursuing a long-term career in software is still a great choice, but we should be sure to adopt AI tools in our work. Many professions will be here for a long time, but workers who know how to use AI effectively will replace workers who don’t.</em></p><p><em>I hope you find this framework useful when you’re coming up with ideas for AI projects. If our projects affect someone else’s work, let’s work hard to protect people’s livelihoods. I hope that by building AI systems, we can create — and fairly share — value for everyone.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!<br>Andrew</em></p><hr><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/09/Diffusion.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Graphic model of Stable Audio's diffusion and transcoding process\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1120\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/Diffusion.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/Diffusion.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/09/Diffusion.png 1120w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"music-generation-for-the-masses\">Music Generation For the Masses </h1><p>Text-to-music generation has arrived.</p><p><strong>What's new: </strong>Stability.ai, maker of the Stable Diffusion image generator and StableLM text generator, launched <a href=\"https://stability.ai/research/stable-audio-efficient-timing-latent-diffusion?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=275114737&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--8qpeB2Emnw2azdA7MUwcyW6ldvi6BGFbh6V8P4cOaIpmsuFpP6GzvLG1zZEytqv7y1anY_NZhryjzrOwYqla7Q1zmQkP_P92A14SvAHfJX3f4aLU\" rel=\"noopener\">Stable Audio</a>, a system that generates music and sound effects from text.
