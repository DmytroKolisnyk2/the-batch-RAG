Sadly, the reality is very different.</em></p><p><em>Some retail investors in GameStop made money last week. But automated trading driven by AI now surpasses the speed and knowledge of most retail investors.

The model could be finished as early as August, team member Connor Leahy told <em>The Batch</em>.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The goal is to match the speed and performance of the fully fledged, 175 billion-parameter version of GPT-3, with extra attention to weeding out social biases.

That motivated outside researchers, including Leahy, to try to <a href=\"https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/gpt-2?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">replicate the model</a>.

Researchers cracked it in short order.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> InstaHide aims to scramble images in a way that can’t be reversed. Nicholas Carlini and researchers at Berkeley, Columbia, Google, Princeton, Stanford, University of Virginia, and University of Wisconsin <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05315?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">defeated</a> InstaHide to recover images that look a lot like the originals.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> InstaHide can be viewed as a linear equation that scrambles images by summing them (typically two sensitive and four public images chosen at random) using random weights, then randomly flipping the sign of each pixel value. But summing is reversible, and changing signs doesn’t effectively obscure values. Consequently, a linear equation can be devised to reverse this process.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors applied InstaHide to produce targets. <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100</a>, and <a href=\"https://ai.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">STL-10</a> stood in for sensitive datasets. <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5206848?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ImageNet</a> served as their non-sensitive dataset. Then they undid the effects of the InstaHide algorithm in reverse order.</p><ul><li>The attack first takes the absolute value of a scrambled image to make all pixel values positive.

(In this work, common parents were highly unlikely to be non-sensitive due to ImageNet’s large number of examples. The equation accounts for such images as though they were noise.)</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors tested their approach using the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 test sets as proxies for sensitive data. Subjectively, the reconstructed images closely resembled the originals. They also tried it on the <a href=\"https://github.com/Hazelsuko07/InstaHide_Challenge?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">InstaHide Challenge</a>, a collection of 5,000 scrambled versions of 100 images published by the InstaHide team. They found an approximate solution in under an hour, and InstaHide’s inventors agreed that they had met the challenge.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Once personally identifiable information is leaked, it’s impossible to unleak. Machine learning must protect privacy with the utmost rigor.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> The authors show that their method can work well if the scrambled training images are available.

New work shows that some neural networks can approach this kind of performance.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> DeepMind researchers led by Vladimir Mikulik showed that recurrent neural nets (RNNs) with meta-training, or training on several related tasks, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11223?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">behave like Bayes-optimal models</a>.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Theoretically, memory-based models like RNNs, given sufficient meta-training, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03030?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">become Bayes-optimal</a>. To test this hypothesis, the researchers compared outputs and the internal states of both types of model.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers meta-trained 14 RNNs on various prediction and reinforcement learning tasks. For instance, to predict the outcome of flipping a biased coin, the model observed coins with various biases. Then they compared each RNN to a known Bayes-optimal solution.</p><ul><li>Each RNN comprised a fully connected layer, an LSTM layer, and a final fully connected layer. The authors trained the RNNs for 20 time steps, altered variables specific to the task at hand (such as the bias of the flipped coin), and repeated the process for a total of 10 million time steps. The corresponding Bayes-optimal models consisted of simple rules.</li><li>The authors fed the same input to RNN and Bayes-optimal models and compared their outputs. For prediction tasks, they compared <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">KL divergence</a>, a measure of similarity between two probability distributions. For reinforcement learning tasks, they compared cumulative reward.</li><li>To compare models’ internal representations, the authors recorded their hidden states and parameter values and used principal component analysis to reduce the RNNs’ dimensions to match the Bayes-optimal models. Then they trained two fully connected models to map RNN states to Bayes-optimal states and vice-versa, and measured their difference using mean-squared error.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> All RNNs converged to behave indistinguishably to their Bayes-optimal counterparts. For instance, the RNN that learned to predict biased coin flips achieved a KL divergence of 0.006 compared to 3.178 before meta-training. The internal states of RNNs and Bayes-optimal models matched nearly perfectly, differing in most tasks by a mean-squared error of less than 0.05.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Bayesian models are reputed to be provably optimal and interpretable. Compared to neural nets, though, they often require more engineering and vastly more computational power. This work involved toy problems in which a Bayes-optimal model could be written by hand, but it’s encouraging to find that meta-trained RNNs performed optimally, too.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Maybe RNNs will become more popular here in the San Francisco Bayes Area.</p>","comment_id":"60bfd1ce274d5b003b1060ed","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/06/gme.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2021-06-08T13:23:42.000-07:00","updated_at":"2023-03-09T08:56:09.000-08:00","published_at":"2021-02-03T12:00:00.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"The price of shares in video game retailer GameStop (NYSE: GME) gyrated wildly last week.
