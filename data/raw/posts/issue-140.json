Many people think that AI means AGI (artificial general intelligence), which remains far away. They don’t understand how deeply AI is already embedded in society. People would be better off if they made personal and business decisions — Should I study radiology? Should I cultivate my company’s ability to produce data? — based on realistic expectations for the future. So let’s get out there and keep helping people to shape a realistic perspective.</em></li><li><em>Much of the infrastructure for building and deploying AI systems, such as MLOps tools, remains to be built. Despite the valiant efforts of many startups and cloud companies, it will be many years before the ecosystem of software infrastructure settles. Infrastructure for data manipulation and storage, and for data-centric approaches in particular, will play a large role. </em></li><li><em>The community of artists who are using AI to create images or music is small but growing quickly. Some are getting by selling NFTs of their work. I’m pleased that artists can make money this way, though I’m nervous about how scalable this revenue stream will be. I hope that individuals with means will continue to support the arts regardless of the resale value of NFTs.</em></li><li><em>Many people in the space industry are excited to take advantage of AI. There are myriad unsolved problems in, say, getting humans to Mars and back, from generating thrust to ensuring a soft landing. These are great opportunities for the AI community.</em></li></ul><p><em>Going to these in-person events has me looking forward to a time, hopefully soon, when DeepLearning.AI and our ambassadors can hold more in-person events safely.

Converting a sequence of numbers into a mathematical expression is analogous to translating one natural language into another.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Given a sequence of numbers, a transformer learned to generate a function made up of operators (such as add, multiply, modulo, and square root), constants, the index of the term to be computed, and references to previous terms.</p><ul><li>To train the model, the authors generated 5 million expressions by sampling from possible values (operators, constants, and so on), assembling them in the proper format, and sampling any values required to start the sequence.

This method was preferable to comparing generated expressions to their true equivalents, as a given expression can take various equivalent forms (by, say, swapping the order of two terms in a sum).</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors compared their symbolic approach with a numeric model (a transformer trained to predict the next 10 terms in a sequence). Generating expressions of up to 10 operators that resulted in integer sequences, the symbolic model achieved 78.4 percent accuracy compared to the numeric model’s 70.3 percent. Generating expressions that resulted in float sequences — a more difficult task — the symbolic model achieved 43.3 percent accuracy compared to the numeric model’s 29 percent. The symbolic model also outperformed <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Ry19WWyXulVfCfotXRWaW8jy9fG0XcqJ2Y0Nkhfy1Rs71s9SggBhPlPcB7vuFaV6x0Ajn\" rel=\"noopener\">Mathematica</a>’s built-in methods for deriving functions from sequences, tested on sequences sampled from the <a href=\"https://oeis.org/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Ry19WWyXulVfCfotXRWaW8jy9fG0XcqJ2Y0Nkhfy1Rs71s9SggBhPlPcB7vuFaV6x0Ajn\" rel=\"noopener\">Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a> (OEIS).
