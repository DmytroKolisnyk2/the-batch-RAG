If you’re preparing to switch roles (say, taking a job as a machine learning engineer for the first time) or industries (say, working in an AI tech company for the first time), there’s a lot about your target job that you probably don’t know. A technique known as informational interviewing is a great way to learn</em><br><br><em>An informational interview involves finding someone in a company or role you’d like to know more about and informally interviewing them about their work. Such conversations are separate from searching for a job. In fact, it’s helpful to interview people who hold positions that align with your interests well before you’re ready to kick off a job search.</em></p><ul><li><em>Informational interviews are particularly relevant to AI. Because the field is evolving, many companies use job titles in inconsistent ways. In one company, data scientists might be expected mainly to analyze business data and present conclusions on a slide deck. In another, they might write and maintain production code. An informational interview can help you sort out what the AI people in a particular company actually do.</em></li><li><em>With the rapid expansion of opportunities in AI, many people will be taking on an AI job for the first time. In this case, an informational interview can be invaluable for learning what happens and what skills are needed to do the job well. For example, you can learn what algorithms, deployment processes, and software stacks a particular company uses. You may be surprised — if you’re not already familiar with the data-centric AI movement — to learn how much time most machine learning engineers spend iteratively cleaning datasets.</em><br></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/08/AI-ML-JOBSEARCH_Info-Interview_1200px-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Job Search Pillar\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/AI-ML-JOBSEARCH_Info-Interview_1200px-1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/08/AI-ML-JOBSEARCH_Info-Interview_1200px-1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/08/AI-ML-JOBSEARCH_Info-Interview_1200px-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Prepare for informational interviews by researching the interviewee and company in advance, so you can arrive with thoughtful questions.

If you can reach out to someone who’s already in your network — perhaps a friend who made the transition ahead of you or someone who attended the same school as you — that’s great! Meetups such as <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/events/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Pie &amp; AI</a> can also help you build your network.</em><br><br><em>Finally, be polite and professional, and thank the people you’ve interviewed. And when you get a chance, please pay it forward as well and help someone coming up after you. If you receive a request for an informational interview from someone in the DeepLearning.AI community, I hope you’ll lean in to help them take a step up!

(a) Alabama prohibited law enforcement agencies from using the technology to establish probable cause during a criminal investigation or when trying to make an arrest. (b) Colorado instituted a similar law that bars state and local government agencies from using it to identify, surveil, or track individuals without a warrant. The same state banned face recognition from all public schools and mandated that government agencies that seek to use the technology provide training and file regular reports. (c) The city of Baltimore, Maryland banned all private and non-police government officials from using face recognition within city limits. (d) Bellingham, Washington, prohibited law enforcement from using face recognition or predictive policing tools.</li><li><strong>Automated decision-making:</strong> Two states and one city limited automated hiring. (a ) Vermont established an agency to review state uses of AI. (b) Illinois employers that use automated hiring software are required to report the race and ethnicity of both successful and unsuccessful applicants. (c) Employers in New York City that use such tools are required to notify job applicants and audit such tools before using them.</li><li><strong>AI education:</strong> Mississippi passed a law directing the state’s education department to produce an artificial intelligence and machine learning curriculum for public schools.</li><li><strong>AI business development:</strong> Two states established government oversight of the technology. (a) Alabama established a council to advise lawmakers on the use and development of automation within the state. (b) Illinois formed a task force to forecast the impact of AI and other technologies on employment, wages, and skill requirements for jobs in the state.</li></ul><p><strong>Pending:</strong> Thirteen more laws are currently in progress in nine states and Washington DC. Bills would establish advisory bodies to study the impacts of AI in California, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island. California lawmakers propose mandating processes to minimize algorithmic bias. Hawaii lawmakers propose a tax credit for AI businesses.<br><strong>Why it matters</strong>: AI increasingly affects U.S. society, sometimes in <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">alarming</a> ways (and at the expense of public <a href=\"https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/can-tech-regain-the-publics-trust/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">trust)</a>. Yet it remains largely unregulated at the national level. State and local legislation are filling the gap. However, a patchwork legal landscape could be a headache for companies that aim to do business in multiple states.<br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> A yawning gap separates leaders in technology and government. Many tech executives hold the stereotype that politicians don't understand technology. Meanwhile, politicians widely regard tech executives as being hostile to the government and primarily out to make a buck. It will take effort on both sides to overcome these stereotypes and forge a shared understanding that leads to better regulations as well as better AI.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/08/SPURIOUS--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Model of classification\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/08/SPURIOUS--1-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"taming-spurious-correlations\">Taming Spurious Correlations</h1><p>When a neural network learns image labels, it may confuse a background item for the labeled object. For example, it may learn to associate the label “camel” with desert sand and then classify a cow on a beach as a camel. New research has trained networks to avoid such mistakes.<br><strong>What’s new:</strong> A team at Stanford and Northeastern University led by Michael Zhang proposed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01517?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Correct-N-Contrast</a> (CNC), a training method that makes neural networks more robust to spurious correlations, in which features and labels are associated but not causally related.<br><strong>Key insight:</strong>  A neural network likely has learned a spurious correlation when it produces dissimilar representations of two images with the same label. When learning representations of two images of a cow, for example, the error may manifest as a representation of a grassy field in one image and a representation of a beach in the other. A contrastive loss function can help a neural network avoid such errors by encouraging it to learn similar representations for similar objects against different backgrounds.<br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors trained models to classify examples and identified examples the models got wrong, possibly owing to spurious correlations. Then they trained a second neural network to classify them correctly using a contrastive loss function.</p><ul><li>The authors trained or fine-tuned a neural network to classify a dataset.

For instance, the ResNet-50 trained on CelebA with CNC achieved 88.8 percent accuracy, while training with EIIL achieved 81.7 percent accuracy. Across all tasks, the authors’ approach achieved 80.9 percent average accuracy while EIIL achieved 74.7 percent average accuracy.<br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08731?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GoNXKtgh3kIYhDbN6wuqn6vTgNYaUE_B6t5EpPdQ9phgpRXVhYpkLoFHDJ7S-TWBi8nwc\" rel=\"noopener\">Group DRO</a>, which provides additional information during training such as a description of the background of an image or the gender of a depicted person, achieved 81.8 percent average accuracy.<br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Previous approaches to managing spurious correlations tend to expand training datasets to capture more variability in data.
