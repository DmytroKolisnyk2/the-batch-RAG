Critics believe the software stifles competition, inflating prices beyond what many renters can afford and adding to an ongoing shortage of affordable housing.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The algorithm analyzes leases for over 13 million units across the U.S. to  calculate prices for 20 million rental units daily. Five of the 10 largest property management firms in the U.S. use it. Former RealPage employees told the authors that property managers adopt around 90 percent of its suggested prices.</p><ul><li>The lease data, which is gathered from YieldStar customers, includes current rental price (which may differ from the rate that’s advertised publicly), number of bedrooms, number of units in a building, and number of nearby units likely to go on the market in the near future.</li><li>The company <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221015092133/https://www.realpage.com/videos/yieldstar-accurate-demand-forecasting/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xp4OpagPbNVeFiHZTir_ZlC9hxo2K9gyQpIEJc0CV04Ah26pERH3KR_gRnmiNBGJo6Tdz\" rel=\"noopener\">advertised</a> that YieldStar could help clients set prices between 3 and 7 percent higher than the market. It removed the information following the report by <em>ProPublica</em>.</li><li>The cost to rent a one-bedroom apartment in a Seattle building with prices set by YieldStar increased 33 percent over one year, while the price of a nearby studio where rents were set manually increased 3.9 percent in the same time period.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Automated pricing has had mixed results in real estate. Offerpad, Opendoor, and Redfin use algorithms to <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/algorithm-as-real-estate-agent/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">estimate</a> a home’s value, and their systems account for around 1 percent of U.S. sales. Zillow <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/price-prediction-turns-perilous/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">shuttered</a> a similar program last year after it contributed to over $600 million in losses.</p><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Experts in real estate and antitrust law say that RealPage’s products enable rival property managers to coordinate pricing, a potential violation of U.S. antitrust law. In addition to the pricing algorithm, the company hosts user groups where property managers share feedback.</p><ul><li>RealPage, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23127400-realpage-statement?responsive=1&title=1&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xp4OpagPbNVeFiHZTir_ZlC9hxo2K9gyQpIEJc0CV04Ah26pERH3KR_gRnmiNBGJo6Tdz\" rel=\"noopener\">responding</a> to the report, asserted that it does not violate antitrust laws because its data is anonymized and aggregated.</li><li>RealPage supporters told <em>ProPublica</em> that a shortage of housing is the real driver behind rising rents.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Advertised rental rates <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/news/redfin-rental-report-march-2022/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xp4OpagPbNVeFiHZTir_ZlC9hxo2K9gyQpIEJc0CV04Ah26pERH3KR_gRnmiNBGJo6Tdz\" rel=\"noopener\">rose</a> 17 percent between March of 2021 and 2022. Several factors contributed to the increase, but automated pricing tools like YieldStar could diminish tenants’ power to negotiate lower rents.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> YieldStar’s role in rising prices is unclear, but any automated system that has potential to manipulate markets at a large scale warrants regulatory oversight. There is precedent: In the 1990s, the U.S. Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archive/atr/public/press_releases/1994/211786.htm?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xp4OpagPbNVeFiHZTir_ZlC9hxo2K9gyQpIEJc0CV04Ah26pERH3KR_gRnmiNBGJo6Tdz\" rel=\"noopener\">forced</a> airlines to change a shared pricing algorithm after finding that they had overcharged travelers by $1 billion. The black-box nature of AI systems means that regulators will need new tools to oversee and audit potential AI-driven coordination of prices.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/unnamed--8--2.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Table with job trends for occupations considered high risk for automation from 1999 to 2029\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/unnamed--8--2.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/unnamed--8--2.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/unnamed--8--2.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"ai-hasn%E2%80%99t-been-so-bad-for-jobs\">AI Hasn’t Been So Bad for Jobs</h1><p>Worries that automation is stealing jobs may have been greatly exaggerated.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> A U.S. government <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2022/article/growth-trends-for-selected-occupations-considered-at-risk-from-automation.htm?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xp4OpagPbNVeFiHZTir_ZlC9hxo2K9gyQpIEJc0CV04Ah26pERH3KR_gRnmiNBGJo6Tdz\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> found that employment has increased in many occupations that may be threatened by automation.</p><p><strong>Projected versus actual growth:</strong> Bureau of Labor Statistics sociologist Michael J.

Researchers probed this ability.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Chen Liang at Zhejiang University and colleagues introduced a dataset and architecture, called Reasoner, that generates text descriptions of hidden, or masked, events in videos. They call this capability <a href=\"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Liang_Visual_Abductive_Reasoning_CVPR_2022_paper.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xp4OpagPbNVeFiHZTir_ZlC9hxo2K9gyQpIEJc0CV04Ah26pERH3KR_gRnmiNBGJo6Tdz\" rel=\"noopener\">Visual Abductive Reasoning</a>.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> To reason about an event in the past or future, it’s necessary to know about events that came before and/or after it, including their order and how far apart they were — what happened immediately before and/or after is most important, and more distant events add further context. A transformer typically encodes the positions of input tokens either one way (a token’s absolute position in the sequence of tokens) or the other (its pairwise distance from every other token), but not both. However, it’s possible to modify these positional encoding styles by producing an embedding for each pair of tokens that’s different from the inversion of each pair — for example, producing different embeddings for the pairs of positions (1,3) and (3,1). This approach captures both the order of events and their distance apart, making it possible to judge the relevance of any event to the events that surround it.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors trained an encoder and decoder. The training dataset included more than 8,600 clips of daily activities found on the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00754?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xp4OpagPbNVeFiHZTir_ZlC9hxo2K9gyQpIEJc0CV04Ah26pERH3KR_gRnmiNBGJo6Tdz\" rel=\"noopener\">web</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07999?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xp4OpagPbNVeFiHZTir_ZlC9hxo2K9gyQpIEJc0CV04Ah26pERH3KR_gRnmiNBGJo6Tdz\" rel=\"noopener\">and</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09099?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xp4OpagPbNVeFiHZTir_ZlC9hxo2K9gyQpIEJc0CV04Ah26pERH3KR_gRnmiNBGJo6Tdz\" rel=\"noopener\">television</a>. Each clip depicted an average of four sequential events with text descriptions such as “a boy throws a frisbee out and his dog is running after it,” “the dog caught the frisbee back,” and “frisbee is in the boy’s hand.” The authors masked one event per clip. The task was to generate a description of each event in a clip including the masked one.</p><ul><li>The authors randomly sampled 50 frames per event and produced a representation of each frame using a pretrained <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xp4OpagPbNVeFiHZTir_ZlC9hxo2K9gyQpIEJc0CV04Ah26pERH3KR_gRnmiNBGJo6Tdz\" rel=\"noopener\">ResNet</a>. They masked selected events.</li><li>The encoder, a vanilla transformer, collected the frame representations into visual representations.

It also produced a confidence score for each description (the average probability per word), which helped successive transformers to refine the descriptions.</li><li>During training, one term of the loss function encouraged the system to generate descriptions similar to the ground-truth descriptions. Another term encouraged it to minimize the difference between the encoder’s representation of masked and unmasked versions of an event.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors compared Reasoner to the best competing method, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07781?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xp4OpagPbNVeFiHZTir_ZlC9hxo2K9gyQpIEJc0CV04Ah26pERH3KR_gRnmiNBGJo6Tdz\" rel=\"noopener\">PDVC</a>, a video captioner trained to perform their task. Three human volunteers evaluated the generated descriptions of masked events in 500 test-set examples drawn at random. Evaluating the descriptions of masked events, the evaluators preferred Reasoner in 29.9 percent of cases, preferred PDVC in 10.4 percent of cases, found them equally good in 13.7 percent of cases, and found them equally bad in 46.0 percent of cases. The authors also pitted Reasoner’s output against descriptions of masked events written by humans. The evaluators preferred human-generated descriptions in 64.8 percent of cases, found them equally good in 22.1 percent of cases, found them equally bad in 4.2 percent of cases, and preferred Reasoner in 8.9 percent of cases.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Reasoning over events in video is impressive but specialized. However, many NLP practitioners can take advantage of the authors’ innovation in using transformers to process text representations. A decoder needs only one transformer to produce descriptions, but the authors improved their descriptions by stacking transformers and using the confidence of previous transformers to help the later ones refine their output.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Given a context, transformer-based text generators often stray from it — sometimes to the point of spinning wild fantasies. This work managed to keep transformers focused on a specific sequence of events, to the extent that they could fill in missing parts of the sequence. Is there a lesson here for keeping transformers moored to reality?</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/unnamed--12--2.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Different charts with data from the fifth annual State of AI Report\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/unnamed--12--2.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/unnamed--12--2.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/unnamed--12--2.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"ai%E2%80%99s-year-in-review\">AI’s Year in Review</h1><p>2022 was a big year for AI-driven upstarts and scientific discovery, according to a new survey.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> The fifth annual <a href=\"https://www.stateof.ai/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xp4OpagPbNVeFiHZTir_ZlC9hxo2K9gyQpIEJc0CV04Ah26pERH3KR_gRnmiNBGJo6Tdz\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>State of AI Report</em></a> details the biggest breakthroughs, business impacts, social trends, and safety concerns.<br><br><strong>Looking back:</strong> Investors Nathan Benaich and Ian Hogarth reviewed research papers, industry surveys, financial reports, funding news, and more. Among their key findings:</p><ul><li>Small AI had an outsized impact. Startups like Stability AI, which was founded in 2019 and already is valued at $1 billion, and upstart research collaborations like BigScience, the group behind the open source <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/large-language-models-unbound/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">BLOOM</a> large language model, are bucking <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2017/12/07/google-leads-in-the-race-to-dominate-artificial-intelligence?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xp4OpagPbNVeFiHZTir_ZlC9hxo2K9gyQpIEJc0CV04Ah26pERH3KR_gRnmiNBGJo6Tdz\" rel=\"noopener\">expectations</a> that tech giants would crowd smaller competitors out of AI innovation. The trend is compounded by an exodus of researchers from places like OpenAI, DeepMind, and Meta, many of whom are joining or launching AI startups.</li><li>AI drove scientific breakthroughs in biochemistry, materials science, mathematics, and <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/high-energy-deep-learning/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">nuclear physics</a>. However, a staggering portion of such research suffers from issues like data leakage (when identical or overly similar examples appear in both training and test sets) and overfitting. Such flaws have prompted fears that AI-driven science is mired in a <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ai-reproducibility-crisis/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">crisis of reproducibility</a>.</li><li>Researchers gave serious attention to safety concerns like harmful output, undesirable social impact, and uncontrolled artificial general intelligence. In one survey of researchers, 69 percent believed that safety deserves a higher priority (up from 68 percent in a 2021 survey and 49 percent in a 2016 survey).</li><li>China’s research community hit the accelerator. U.S. AI researchers published over 10,000 papers in 2022, up 11 percent from the prior year. Their China-based counterparts published less than 7,500 papers, a 24 percent jump from 2021. U.S. researchers led in natural language processing tasks, while Chinese researchers dominated papers on autonomous vehicles, computer vision, and machine translation.</li></ul><p><strong>Looking ahead: </strong>The authors offer predictions for the year ahead. Among them:</p><ul><li>DeepMind will train a 10 billion-parameter multimodal reinforcement learning model, an order of magnitude greater than the company’s 1.2 billion parameter <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/one-model-hundreds-of-tasks/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Gato</a>.</li><li>At least one of the five biggest tech companies will invest over $1 billion in startups devoted to building artificial general intelligence.</li><li>Nvidia’s dominance in AI chips will cause at least one of their high-profile startup competitors to be acquired for less than half its current value or shuttered outright.</li></ul><p><strong>Hits and misses: </strong>The authors also graded their predictions from <a href=\"https://www.stateof.ai/2021-report-launch.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xp4OpagPbNVeFiHZTir_ZlC9hxo2K9gyQpIEJc0CV04Ah26pERH3KR_gRnmiNBGJo6Tdz\" rel=\"noopener\">last year</a>. A sampling:</p><ul><li>Correct: DeepMind would make a major breakthrough in the physical sciences. (The Google division helped publish three papers, including <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03697-8?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xp4OpagPbNVeFiHZTir_ZlC9hxo2K9gyQpIEJc0CV04Ah26pERH3KR_gRnmiNBGJo6Tdz\" rel=\"noopener\">work</a> that found materials’ electron configurations and, consequently, their properties.)</li><li>Incorrect: One or more startups devoted to making specialized AI chips, such as Graphcore, Cerebras, or Mythic, would be acquired by a larger firm.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>As investors, the authors earn their bread, butter, and Teslas by developing a keen sense of which tech trends have the greatest commercial value. Their perspective may not be omniscient, but it can be helpful to know what the funders are betting on.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>We’re not enamored of projections in a field that changes as rapidly as AI, but we’re happy when forecasters take a critical look at their own previous predictions.</p>","comment_id":"63751e799ddf78004decaa19","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/11/unnamed--6--1.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-11-16T09:31:37.000-08:00","updated_at":"2023-02-08T12:11:15.000-08:00","published_at":"2022-11-16T13:02:32.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"The Batch - AI News & Insights: The population of Earth officially reached 8 billion this week.
