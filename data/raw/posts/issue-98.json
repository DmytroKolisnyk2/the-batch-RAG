In short, it can be hard to tell whether it’s practical to build a particular AI system. That’s why it’s worthwhile to quickly assess technical feasibility before committing resources to build a full product.</em><br><br><em>If you have no data or only a handful of examples (enough to get a sense of the problem specification but too few to train an algorithm), consider the following principles:</em></p><ul><li><em>For problems that involve unstructured data (images, audio, text), if even humans can’t perform the task, it will be very hard for AI to do it.</em></li><li><em>A literature review or analysis of what other teams (including competitors) have done may give you a sense of what’s feasible.</em></li></ul><p><em>If you have a small amount of data, training on that data might give you some signals. At the proof-of-concept stage, often the training and test sets are drawn from the same distribution. In that case:</em></p><ul><li><em>If your system is unable to do well on the training set, that’s a strong sign that the input features </em>x<em> do not contain enough information to predict </em>y<em>. If you can’t improve the input features </em>x<em>, this problem will be hard to crack.</em></li><li><em>If the system does well on the training set but not the test set, there’s still hope. Plotting a learning curve (to extrapolate how performance might look with a larger dataset) and benchmarking human-level performance (HLP) can give a better sense of feasibility.</em></li><li><em>If the system does well on the test set, the question remains open whether it will generalize to real-world data.</em></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-22-at-5.56.08-PM-copy.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Magnifying glass over the words Unclear, Technical and Feasibility\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-22-at-5.56.08-PM-copy.png 600w\"></figure><p><em>If you’re building a product to serve multiple customers (say, a system to help different hospitals process medical records) and each customer will input data from a different distribution (say, each hospital has a different way of coding medical records), getting data from a few hospitals will also help you assess technical feasibility.</em><br><br><em>Given the heightened technical risk of building AI products, when <a href=\"http://aifund.ai/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_y7LKn2OW8eVKFWN6aYCjxUI-sOF4aNoqsVlfHqHvZqO66RnPZbAPo4wwMyW2fo5iNqSLEHOGgkqNU2QwzSqK0HJUNdw\" rel=\"noopener\">AI Fund</a> (Deeplearning.AI’s sister company that supports startups) looks at a company, it pays close attention to the team’s technical expertise.
