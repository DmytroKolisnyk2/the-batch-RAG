Pretraining an LLM on its own directly generated responses to prompts doesn't help. But if an agentic workflow implemented with the LLM results in higher quality output than the LLM can generate directly, then training on that output becomes potentially useful.</p><p>Just as humans can learn from their own thinking, perhaps LLMs can, too. For example, imagine a math student who is learning to write mathematical proofs. By solving a few problems — even without external input — they can reflect on what does and doesn’t work and, through practice, learn how to more quickly generate good proofs.&nbsp;</p><p>Broadly, LLM training involves (i) pretraining (learning from unlabeled text data to predict the next word) followed by (ii) instruction fine-tuning (learning to follow instructions) and (iii) RLHF/DPO tuning to align the LLM’s output to human values. Step (i) requires many orders of magnitude more data than the other steps. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8k0LiZQvRWFPDGgDt43tNF902ROx3dTDBEvtdF-XpX81iwHOkMt0-y9vAGM94bcVF8ZSYc\" rel=\"noopener\">Llama 3</a>&nbsp;was pretrained on over 15 trillion tokens, and LLM developers are still hungry for more data. Where can we get more text to train on?&nbsp;</p><p>Many developers train smaller models directly on the output of larger models, so a smaller model learns to mimic a larger model’s behavior on a particular task. However, an LLM can’t learn much by training on data it generated directly, just like a supervised learning algorithm can’t learn from trying to predict labels it generated by itself.

In this case, the LLM’s higher-quality output might be useful as pretraining data for the LLM itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Efforts like these have precedents:</p><ul><li>When using&nbsp; reinforcement learning to play a game like chess, a model might learn a function that evaluates board positions. If we apply game tree search along with a low-accuracy evaluation function, the model can come up with more accurate evaluations. Then we can train that evaluation function to mimic these more accurate values.</li><li>In the alignment step, Anthropic’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8k0LiZQvRWFPDGgDt43tNF902ROx3dTDBEvtdF-XpX81iwHOkMt0-y9vAGM94bcVF8ZSYc\" rel=\"noopener\">constitutional AI</a>&nbsp;method uses RLAIF (RL from AI Feedback) to judge the quality of LLM outputs, substituting feedback generated by an AI model for human feedback.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>A significant barrier to using LLMs prompted via agentic workflows to produce their own training data is the cost of generating tokens. Say we want to generate 1 trillion tokens to extend a pre-existing training dataset. Currently, at publicly announced prices, generating 1 trillion tokens using GPT-4-turbo ($30 per million output tokens), Claude 3 Opus ($75), Gemini 1.5 Pro ($21), and Llama-3-70B on Groq ($0.79) would cost, respectively, $30M, $75M, $21M and $790K. Of course, an agentic workflow that uses a design pattern like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/agentic-design-patterns-part-2-reflection/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8k0LiZQvRWFPDGgDt43tNF902ROx3dTDBEvtdF-XpX81iwHOkMt0-y9vAGM94bcVF8ZSYc\" rel=\"noopener\">Reflection</a>&nbsp;would require generating more than one token per token that we would use as training data. But budgets for training cutting-edge LLMs easily surpass $100M, so spending a few million dollars more for data to boost performance is quite feasible.</p><p>That’s why I believe agentic workflows will open up intriguing new opportunities for high-quality synthetic data generation.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep learning!</p><p>Andrew</p><p>P.S. In “Prompt Engineering for Vision Models,” taught by Abby Morgan, Jacques Verré, and Caleb Kaiser of Comet, you’ll learn how to prompt and fine-tune a variety of vision models for image generation, image editing, object detection, and&nbsp; segmentation. For example, you’ll use OWL-ViT to detect an object you describe in a text prompt, pass the bounding box to SAM to create a segmentation mask, and feed the mask into Stable Diffusion with a text prompt to replace the original object with a new one. Controlling vision models can be tricky, and this course will teach you the techniques to control their output.

Yet Amazon’s retreat from Just Walk Out in larger stores suggests that the technology is less well suited to such environments. In addition, shoppers may not have adjusted easily to grab-and-go behavior, which removes social interactions with cashiers and encourages customers to spend without reviewing the bill.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;AI has the potential to revolutionize every field, including retailing, and it’s important to find productive uses for it.

Evans at University of Chicago proposed a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01648-z?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8k0LiZQvRWFPDGgDt43tNF902ROx3dTDBEvtdF-XpX81iwHOkMt0-y9vAGM94bcVF8ZSYc\" rel=\"noopener\">method to predict new scientific discoveries</a>&nbsp;by building a graph that connects researchers, their objects of study, and the scientific properties thereof. They evaluated their approach using data from materials science.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;Overlapping interests among researchers may indicate areas where further research would be fruitful. For example, if one group of researchers studies a material A and its property P, a second group studies materials A and B, and another group studies materials B and C, it may turn out that material C exhibits property P.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors tried to predict whether certain inorganic materials have certain electrical properties based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://europepmc.org/article/med/31270483?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8k0LiZQvRWFPDGgDt43tNF902ROx3dTDBEvtdF-XpX81iwHOkMt0-y9vAGM94bcVF8ZSYc\" rel=\"noopener\">scientific literature</a>&nbsp;through the year 2000. From 1.5 million articles that described 100,000 inorganic compounds, they extracted the author names, materials mentioned (for example, sodium nitrite), and their properties (for example, thermoelectricity, the ability to convert heat into electricity and vice versa). They used this data to construct a graph whose nodes were authors, materials, and properties. Edges connected the nodes that appeared in the same paper, for example a particular author whose paper covered specific material or property.</p><ul><li>The authors conducted random walks through the graph, stepping from node to node, to produce sequences of authors, materials, and properties. Then they removed the authors from the sequences, because they were interested mainly in establishing possible connections between materials and properties.&nbsp;</li><li>They trained&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8k0LiZQvRWFPDGgDt43tNF902ROx3dTDBEvtdF-XpX81iwHOkMt0-y9vAGM94bcVF8ZSYc\" rel=\"noopener\">Word2Vec</a>, which computes word embeddings, on their sequences, treating materials and properties as words and sequences as documents. This yielded an embedding for each material and property.</li><li>To predict possible discoveries — that is, which material might exhibit a given property — the authors scored each material based on (i) the similarity between the material’s embedding and the given property’s embedding and (ii) the smallest number of edges in the path that connected each material and the property. Then they summed scores (i) and (ii). The 50 highest-scoring materials were predicted to have the property (that weren’t directly connected in the graph; that is, excluding materials that already were known to have the property).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors predicted which materials possessed each of three properties. They compared their results with predictions obtained in a similar way using a Word2Vec model trained exclusively on text from scientific papers. They used papers from 2001 through 2018 to evaluate the predictions. For thermoelectricity, the cumulative precision (percentage of predicted discoveries proven correct) was 76 percent, while the cumulative precision of the alternative method was 48 percent. The cumulative precision of random guesses was about 3 percent. The authors obtained similar results for the other two properties.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Science is a social endeavor, where the connections between people and their work can be represented as a graph that reflects the collective attention of the scientific community. The collective attention acts as a signal that predicts promising avenues for further research — a signal that machine learning can help to tease out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We're thinking:</strong>&nbsp;The authors also predicted drug discoveries with similarly good results. Their method may be useful for identifying fruitful directions in other scientific areas, and perhaps in other domains entirely.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p>This week's <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/tag/data-points/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Data Points</a> features these highlights: Adobe's latest Firefly Image 3 model, enhanced smart glasses with Meta’s AI assistant, an AI-powered gene editor, and more.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/data-points-issue-247/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Catch up on the latest in AI now.</a></p>","comment_id":"6632a16f61838300011fc537","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/05/unnamed--57--1.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2024-05-01T13:09:19.000-07:00","updated_at":"2024-05-16T12:45:32.000-07:00","published_at":"2024-05-01T13:39:36.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"The Batch AI News and Insights: Inexpensive token generation and agentic workflows for large language models (LLMs) open up intriguing new possibilities for training LLMs on synthetic data.
