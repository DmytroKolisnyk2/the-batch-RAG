MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab <a href=\"https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/TinyImages/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">removed</a> Tiny Images from its website and requested that users delete their copies as well.</p><p><strong>What the study found:</strong> Researchers at the University College of Dublin and UnifyID, an authentication startup, conducted an “ethical audit” of several large vision datasets, each containing many millions of images. They focused on Tiny Images as an example of how social bias proliferates in machine learning.</p><ul><li>Psychologists and linguists at Princeton in 1985 compiled a database of word relationships called WordNet. Their work has served as a cornerstone in natural language processing.</li><li>Scientists at MIT CSAIL compiled Tiny Images in 2006 by searching the internet for images associated with words in WordNet. The database includes racial and gender-based slurs, so Tiny Images collected photos labeled with such terms.</li></ul><p><strong>What the dataset’s creators said:</strong> “Biases, offensive and prejudicial images, and derogatory terminology alienates [sic] an important part of our community — precisely those that we are making efforts to include,” the researchers who built Tiny Images said in a statement.</p><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Social bias — in data an d models, in the industry, and in society at large — has emerged as a major issue in the machine learning community.</p><ul><li>Concerns over bias in AI <a href=\"https://thegradient.pub/pulse-lessons/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">reignited</a> last week after a generative model called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03808?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Pulse</a> converted a pixelated picture of Barack Obama, who is Black, into a high-resolution image of a white man.</li><li>The compilers of ImageNet recently <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.07726.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">culled</a> labels — also <a href=\"http://www.image-net.org/download-API?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">based on WordNet</a> — deemed biased or offensive from the dataset’s person subtree.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: Social biases encoded in training data become entwined with the foundations of machine learning. WordNet transmitted its derogatory, stereotyped, and inaccurate information to Tiny Images, which may have passed them along to countless real-world applications. <br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>As AI practitioners, we have a responsibility to re-examine the ways we collect and use data. For instance, Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 were derived from TinyImages. We’re not aware of biases in those datasets, but when one dataset’s bias may propagate to another, it’s necessary to track data provenance and address any problems discovered in an upstream data source. Recent proposals set standards for documenting <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">models</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">datasets</a> to weed out harmful biases before they take root.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DETR.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Examples of detection of animals in images using Detection Transformer (DETR).\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"computer-vision-transformed\">Computer Vision Transformed</h3><p>The transformer architecture that has shaken up natural language processing may replace recurrent layers in object detection networks.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> A Facebook team led by Nicolas Carion and Francisco Massa simplified object detection pipelines by using transformers, yielding Detection Transformer (DETR).<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Images can show multiple objects. Some object detection networks use recurrent layers to predict one object at a time until all objects are accounted for. Language models use <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">transformers</a> to evaluate a sequence of words in one pass. Similarly, DETR uses them to predict all objects in an image in a single process.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> DETR predicts a fixed number of object bounding boxes and classes per image. First, it extracts image features using convolutional layers. Then transformers predict features associated with regions likely to contain objects. Feed-forward layers process the object features into classes and bounding boxes. (“No object” is a possible class.)</p><ul><li>The transformers generate object bounding boxes and labels as a sequence, but their order is arbitrary.</li><li>The loss function uses the <a href=\"https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~pettie/matching/Kuhn-hungarian-assignment.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Hungarian algorithm</a> to match each object class (except “no object”) with a unique label. This makes predicting anchors (box center points) and complicated matching algorithms unnecessary.</li><li>During training, each transformer layer makes its own prediction. Evaluating this output ensures that all transformers learn to contribute equally — a technique borrowed from language models that’s not available with recurrent layers. The additional loss function especially helps the system predict the correct number of objects.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers pitted DETR against <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Faster R-CNN</a> on the canonical object detection dataset <a href=\"http://cocodataset.org/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Coco</a>. At model sizes of roughly 40 million parameters, DETR bettered Faster R-CNN’s average precision, a measure of true positives, from 0.402 to 0.420.

So he pre-processes the input using Photoshop to amplify or de-emphasize certain features. “You learn when to exaggerate or take stuff out before you feed it to the network,” he said. Then he adjusts the output’s skin color, eye shape, and age.</li><li>For his <a href=\"https://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/images/an-artists-impression-of-napoleon-produced-by-artificial-intelligence-may-2020/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Napoleon</a> portrait, Uterwijk integrated a large number of historical portraits, drawings, and sculptures.

It takes a lot of rotated training images to teach convolutional filters this simple fact. A new filter design has this common-sense knowledge built-in.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Simon Graham led a team at the University of Warwick to create the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03037?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Dense Steerable Filter CNN</a> (DSF-CNN), a convolutional neural network that can see a picture in various rotations and generate consistent output.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Pixels are tiny squares. Rotating them by increments other than 90 degrees results in distortion and lost information. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07289?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Earlier work</a> developed so-called steerable filters that eliminate distortion by subdividing their weights and recombining them to create the desired rotation. DSF-CNN builds on that work by incorporating <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">dense connections</a> that improve performance and data efficiency.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> DSF-CNN operates slightly differently on the input and hidden layers. At the input, it extracts initial features for each of several rotational angles (illustrated by figure b above). In the hidden layers, it extracts more complex features at each angle (figure c).</p><ul><li>The researchers evaluated systems with 4, 8, or 12 filters corresponding to rotations of 90, 45, or 30 degrees respectively. The filters share weights, so the model can look at one image from a number of perspectives.</li><li>At the input, DSF-CNN extracts features from each channel of an image by applying a set of filters rotated through various angles. Each filter’s action multiplies the number of channels.</li><li>In the hidden layers, the system re-examines features from previous layers. To keep memory requirements from ballooning, hidden layers apply one filter per channel rather than the full complement.</li><li>For more efficient training, the authors implemented dense connections by concatenating related features from multiple layers.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers tested the 8-filter model on <a href=\"http://basveeling.nl/posts/pcam/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">pathology slides</a>, since medical images come in a variety of orientations. DSF-CNN achieved 0.975 area under the curve (AUC), a measurement of true positives and false positives where 1 is perfect.
