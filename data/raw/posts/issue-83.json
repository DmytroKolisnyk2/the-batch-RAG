That effort successfully boosted user engagement with ads, so he designed similar systems to fill news feeds with highly engaging posts, comments, and groups.</li><li>His team went on to build a machine learning development platform, FBLearner Flow, that was instrumental to helping Facebook scale up its AI efforts. It enabled the company to build, deploy, and monitor over a million models that optimize engagement through tasks like image recognition and content moderation, inadvertently amplifying disinformation and hate speech.</li><li>In 2018, Quiñonero took charge of Responsible AI to investigate and resolve such issues.

Recent research aimed to predict this activity, enabling researchers to identify drugs that might counteract the effects of Covid-19.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Thai-Hoang Pham and colleagues at The Ohio State University and The City University of New York developed <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00285-9?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DeepCE</a>, a system designed to predict how particular drugs will influence the amounts of RNA, and therefore the amounts of various proteins, produced by a cell.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> In machine learning, attention layers learn to represent how the various parts of two input sequences interact with one another. In biology, genes mediate the production of RNA, while drugs can affect the action of genes. Given separate embeddings that represent genes and chemical structures of drugs, attention can capture how a drug affects RNA production. <br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Given a drug, a dose, and a line of cells cloned from a particular patient, DeepCE predicts the amount of RNA produced by each of roughly 1,000 genes. (Collectively, this information constitutes a gene expression profile). The training and test data included more than 600 drugs for a total of over 4,000 gene expression profiles from seven human cell lines in the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867417313090?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">L1000</a> database.</p><ul><li>The authors used the <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2939672.2939754?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">node2vec</a> method to generate embeddings of proteins in a <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/D1/D607/5198476?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">database</a> of relationships among genes and proteins.

DeepCE outperformed all of them with a score of 0.4907. The next-best method, a two-layer feed-forward network, scored 0.4270. They also used DeepCE to look for existing drugs that might treat Covid-19.

Of 25 drugs surfaced by DeepCE, at least five already had shown potential as Covid-19 treatments; others had been used for different viruses with similar symptoms.  <br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Complex datasets may have features that aren’t processed easily by a single network.
