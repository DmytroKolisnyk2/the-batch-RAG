With traditional software, product managers can specify a product in ways that communicate clearly to engineers what to build — for example, by providing a wireframe drawing. But these methods don’t work for AI products.</em></p><p><em>For an AI product, among the most important parts of the specification are:</em></p><ul><li><em>The space of acceptable operating conditions (also called the operational design domain)</em></li><li><em>The level of performance required under various conditions, including machine learning metrics such as accuracy and software metrics such as latency and throughput</em></li></ul><p><em>Consider the problem of how to build a self-driving car. We might decide the acceptable road conditions for autonomous operation and the acceptable rate of collisions with particular objects at various speeds (for example, gently bumping a traffic cone at five miles per hour every 1 million miles may be okay, but hitting a pedestrian at 20 miles per hour every 1,000 miles is not).</em></p><p><em>Or take reading electronic health records. What is an acceptable error rate when diagnosing a serious disease? How about the error rate when diagnosing a minor disease? What if human-level performance for a particular illness is low, so physicians tend to misdiagnose it, too?</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/cartoon--3--copy.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Cartoon about traditional software and AI\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/07/cartoon--3--copy.jpeg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/07/cartoon--3--copy.jpeg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/cartoon--3--copy.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Specifying the metrics, and the dataset or data distribution on which the metrics are to be assessed, gives machine learning teams a target to aim for. In this process, we might decide how to define a serious versus a minor disease and whether these are even appropriate concepts to define a product around. Engineers find it convenient to optimize a single metric (such as average test-set accuracy), but it’s not unusual for a practical specification to require optimizing multiple metrics.</em></p><p><em>Here are some ideas that I have found useful for specifying AI products.</em></p><ul><li><em>Clearly define <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-machine-learning-in-production/lecture/AjC2P/performance-auditing?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">slices</a> (or subsets) of data that raise concerns about the system’s performance. One slice might be minor diseases and another major diseases. If the system is intended to make predictions tied to individuals, we might check for undesirable biases by specifying slices that correspond to users of different age groups, genders, ethnicities, and so on.</em></li><li><em>For each slice, specify a level of performance that meets the user’s need, if it’s technically feasible. Also, examine performance across slices to ensure that the system meets reasonable standards of fairness.</em></li><li><em>If the algorithm performs poorly on one slice, it may not be fruitful to tweak the code. Consider using a data-centric approach to improve the quality of data in that slice. Often this is the most efficient way to address the problem.</em></li></ul><p><em>I’ve found it very helpful to have sufficient data and a clear target specification for each slice. This isn’t always easy or even possible, but it helps the team advance toward a reasonable target.</em><br><br><em>As a team performs experiments and develops a sense of what’s possible as well as where the system might falter, the appropriate slices can change. If you’re a machine learning engineer who is part-way through the project, and the product manager changes the product specification, don’t be frustrated! Ask them to buy you a coffee (or tea or other beverage of your choice) for your trouble, but recognize that this is part of developing a machine learning system. Hopefully such changes will happen less frequently as the team gains experience.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em><br><br><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h2 id=\"news\">News</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/NOTRAFFIC-REVISED.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Video showing traffic signals controlled by AI \" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/NOTRAFFIC-REVISED.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"lighter-traffic-ahead\">Lighter Traffic Ahead</h1><p>Traffic signals controlled by AI are keeping vehicles rolling citywide.</p><p><strong>What’s new: </strong>Several U.S. cities are testing systems from Israel-based startup NoTraffic that promise to cut both commute times and carbon emissions, according to <a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/traffic-control-system-red-lights-artificial-intelligence-ai/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--BLcGdrnQNkKoFecXVa1Cpckmz_Su-3IHByaQKd9k_sy0_RSR8Dtr-x4nuefSVtf5wtg9R\"><em>MotorTrend</em></a>. The company plans to expand to 41 cities by the end of 2021.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> NoTraffic uses a combination of neural networks and other techniques to optimize intersections and coordinate traffic signals throughout a city. The system is outfitted to integrate with pavement sensors and connected-vehicle protocols.</p><ul><li>Cameras installed at intersections run models that detect and classify oncoming vehicles, bikes, and pedestrians, and calculate their speed and location.</li><li>They stream anonymized data to control modules housed in traffic signals, which aggregate the sensor outputs and optimize signal operation. For instance, the system can turn a green light red if there are no cars coming, or change a red light to green as an emergency vehicle approaches.</li><li>The data is streamed to the cloud for optimization over larger areas and transmitted back to control modules to account for broader traffic patterns. For example, the system can coordinate multiple lights to reroute traffic around a road that has been closed due to an accident.</li><li>In a two month trial, <a href=\"https://notraffic.tech/trusted-by/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--BLcGdrnQNkKoFecXVa1Cpckmz_Su-3IHByaQKd9k_sy0_RSR8Dtr-x4nuefSVtf5wtg9R\">Redlands, CA</a>, found that installing the systems in 2 percent of intersections spared commuters a total of 900 hours of gridlock, which translated to an extra $331,380 in economic productivity.</li><li>The Redlands trial also staved off 11 tons of greenhouse gas emissions.

An alternative is to learn from expert demonstrations, a technique known as behavioral cloning. Where such demonstrations are hard to collect, publicly broadcast matches can stand in.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The system generated a representation of each video frame using a convolutional neural network and combined multiple representations using a convolutional LSTM. A linear layer decided what action to take per frame.</p><ul><li>The authors pretrained the system on 70 hours (4 million frames) of broadcast matches that pitted one team against another. They used handcrafted rules to label the frames with a player’s action: moving forward or backward, shooting, reloading, or changing the field of view.</li><li>They fine-tuned the system on four hours (200,000 frames) of gameplay by a player who ranked in the Top 10 percent worldwide. They labeled this data using mouse and keyboard input to label the player’s action.</li><li>During training, the system learned to minimize the difference between the predicted and recorded actions.</li><li>At inference, the system chose how to move its onscreen character (for example, forward) and where to move the mouse cursor (which controls what the character can see) according to the model’s highest-probability prediction. It executed actions like shooting or reloading if the action’s probability was greater than a randomly generated number.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Pitted against the game’s built-in medium-difficulty agent, which takes advantage of information that humans don’t have access to (such as the positions of all players), the author’s system came out on top. It achieved 2.67 kills per minute and 1.25 kills per death, compared to the built-in agent’s 1.97 kills per minute and 1.00 kills per death. Against human players in the top 10 percent, it didn’t fare so well. It achieved 0.5 kills per minute and 0.26 kills per death compared to the human average of 4.27 kills per minute and 2.34 kills per death</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Behavioral cloning is a viable alternative to reinforcement learning — within the limits of available expert demonstrations. The authors’ system even learned the classic gamer swagger of jumping and spinning while it reloaded.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> We’re in the mood for a nonviolent round of <a href=\"https://splatoon.nintendo.com/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--BLcGdrnQNkKoFecXVa1Cpckmz_Su-3IHByaQKd9k_sy0_RSR8Dtr-x4nuefSVtf5wtg9R\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Splatoon</em></a>.</p><hr><h3 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/Course-Name-2-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/07/Course-Name-2-2.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/07/Course-Name-2-2.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/Course-Name-2-2.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Learn how to automate a natural language processing task in “Build, Train, and Deploy ML Pipelines Using BERT,” Course 2 in our new <em>Practical Data Science Specialization.</em> You'll build an end-to-end pipeline using Hugging Face’s optimized implementation of the state-of-the-art BERT algorithm using Amazon SageMaker Pipelines. <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-custom-ml-models?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Enroll now</a></p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/ZILLOW.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"New approach to automated real-estate assessment\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/ZILLOW.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"home-sweet-ai-appraised-home\">Home Sweet AI-Appraised Home</h1><p>Real estate websites helped turn automated real-estate assessment into a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05489?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--BLcGdrnQNkKoFecXVa1Cpckmz_Su-3IHByaQKd9k_sy0_RSR8Dtr-x4nuefSVtf5wtg9R\">classic</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11406?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--BLcGdrnQNkKoFecXVa1Cpckmz_Su-3IHByaQKd9k_sy0_RSR8Dtr-x4nuefSVtf5wtg9R\">AI</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00919?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--BLcGdrnQNkKoFecXVa1Cpckmz_Su-3IHByaQKd9k_sy0_RSR8Dtr-x4nuefSVtf5wtg9R\">problem</a>.
