This is true of countries as well.</p><p>I was recently in Thailand, where I was delighted to see tremendous momentum building in AI (and sip the best Thai ice tea I’ve ever tasted). Even though Thailand is not as advanced in AI technology or applications as leading tech countries, the enthusiasm for building AI throughout government, corporations, and academia was thrilling. I came away heartened that AI’s benefits will be spread among many countries and convinced that one’s level of AI development right now matters less than your momentum toward increasing it.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing the momentum behind AI in Thailand — where the per capita GDP is around one fifth that of Japan, and one tenth that of the United States — left me feeling that any country, company, or person has a shot at doing meaningful work in the field. While advanced economies such as the U.S. and China are still in the lead, generative AI has made the playing field more level. Foundation models, especially those with open weights, are significantly lowering the barriers to building meaningful AI projects. In Thailand, a lot of people I met weren’t just talking about AI, they were rolling up their sleeves and building. That buys a nation a lot more momentum than just talk.<br><br>I met with Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin and his Ministers of Higher Education and Education (primary/secondary) along with many staffers. It was delightful to hear the PM speak of his enthusiasm for AI. The ministers discussed how to (i) provide AI training and (ii) use AI to improve education in a variety of subjects. Happily, the focus was on creating value while thinking through realistic risks like AI’s potential to proliferate misinformation, and not a single person asked me about whether AI will lead to human extinction!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/08/unnamed---2024-08-14T145457.617-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/unnamed---2024-08-14T145457.617-1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/unnamed---2024-08-14T145457.617-1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/08/unnamed---2024-08-14T145457.617-1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>I also met with many business leaders and enjoyed seeing a rapid pace of experimentation with AI. KBTG, an affiliate of the country’s leading digital bank KBank, is working on a financial chatbot advisor, AI-based identity verification for anti-fraud, AI for auto insurance, and a Thai-language financial large language model. These features are growing mobile banking and increasing financial access. Many business leaders in other sectors, too, have asked their teams to run experiments. There are many AI applications yet to be built in industrial sectors, tourism, trade, and more! (KBTG is an investor in AI Fund, which I lead.)</p><p>I often visit universities in both developed and developing economies, and I’ve been surprised to see that universities in developing economies sometimes adopt AI faster. At Chulalongkorn University (known as Chula), I met with the University President Wilert Puriwat and Director of Chula AI Professor Proadpran Punyabukkana. Chula AI has rolled out campus-wide training in generative AI for faculty, staff, and students. In addition, it supports building AI applications such as AI screening for depression and gastrointestinal cancer.&nbsp;<br><br>It takes years to build up advanced technology. But momentum matters, and there will be many rewards along the journey. There’s no time like the present to start building!&nbsp;</p><p>Keep building,</p><p>Andrew&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/improving-accuracy-of-llm-applications?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/08/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-08-13T091442.999.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-08-13T091442.999.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-08-13T091442.999.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/08/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-08-13T091442.999.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/08/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-08-13T091442.999.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Our short course “Improving Accuracy of LLM Applications” teaches a step-by-step approach to improving the accuracy of applications built on large language models.

For instance, GPT-4 costs $30/$60 per million tokens input/output. Since then, models have notched higher benchmark performances even prices have fallen. The latest models are also faster, have larger context windows, support a wider range of input types, and do better at complex tasks such as agentic workflows.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Competition is fierce to provide the most effective and efficient large language models, offering an extraordinary range of price and performance to developers. Makers of foundation models that can’t match the best large models in performance or the best small models in cost are in a tight corner.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;What an amazing time to be developing AI applications!

Their relative length, cultural nuances, idiomatic expressions, and expression of an author’s individual style call for skills beyond swapping words in one language for semantically equivalent words in another. Researchers built a machine translation system to address these issues.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;Minghao Wu and colleagues at Monash University, University of Macau, and Tencent AI Lab proposed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11804?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RMXWGsKy0WW01ALuV3mCHajvIKy9s9v2oeXw5xXoB2OH_ZKtd52TGYLG9e1arEzrz0A2t\" rel=\"noopener\">TransAgents</a>, which uses a multi-agent workflow to translate novels from Chinese to English. You can try a demo&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.transagents.ai/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RMXWGsKy0WW01ALuV3mCHajvIKy9s9v2oeXw5xXoB2OH_ZKtd52TGYLG9e1arEzrz0A2t\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Key insight:&nbsp;</strong>Prompting a large language model (LLM) to translate literature often results in subpar quality. Employing multiple LLMs to mimic human roles involved in translation breaks down this complex problem into more tractable parts. For example, separate LLMs (or instances of a single LLM) can act as agents that take on roles such as translator and localization specialist, and they can check and revise each other’s work. An agentic workflow raises unsolved problems such as how to evaluate individual agents’ performance and how to measure translation quality. This work offers a preliminary exploration.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;TransAgents prompted pretrained LLMs to act like a translation company working on a dataset of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www2.statmt.org/wmt23/literary-translation-task.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RMXWGsKy0WW01ALuV3mCHajvIKy9s9v2oeXw5xXoB2OH_ZKtd52TGYLG9e1arEzrz0A2t\" rel=\"noopener\">novels</a>. The set included 20 Chinese novels, each containing 20 chapters, accompanied by human translations into English.</p><ul><li>GPT-4 Turbo generated text descriptions of 30 workers. Each description specified attributes such as role, areas of specialty, education, years of experience, nationality, gender, and pay scale. The authors prompted 30 instances of GPT-4 Turbo to take on one of these personas. Two additional instances acted as the company’s CEO and personnel manager (or “ghost agent” in the authors’ parlance).</li><li>Given a project, the system assembled a team. First it prompted the CEO to select a senior editor, taking into account the languages and worker profiles. The personnel manager evaluated the CEO’s choices and, if it determined they were suboptimal, prompted the CEO to reconsider. Then the system prompted the CEO and senior editor to select the rest of the team, talking back and forth until they agreed on a junior editor, translator, localization specialist, and proofreader.</li><li>Next the system generated a guide document to be included in every prompt going forward. The junior editor generated and the senior editor refined a summary of each chapter and a glossary of important terms and their translations in the target language. Given the chapter summaries, the senior editor synthesized a plot summary. In addition, the senior editor generated guidelines for tone, style, and target audience using a randomly chosen chapter as reference.</li><li>The team members collaborated to translate the novel chapter by chapter. The translator proposed an initial translation. The junior editor reviewed it for accuracy and adherence to the guidelines. The senior editor evaluated the work so far and revised it accordingly. The localization specialist adapted the text to fit the audience’s cultural context. The proofreader checked for language errors. Then the junior and senior editors critiqued the work of the localization specialist and proofreader and revised the draft accordingly.</li><li>Finally, the senior editor reviewed the work, assessing the quality of each chapter and ensuring smooth transitions between chapters.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;Professional translators compared TransAgents’ output with that of human translators and GPT-4 Turbo in a blind test. One said TransAgents “shows the greatest depth and sophistication,” while another praised its “sophisticated wording and personal flair” that “effectively conveys the original text’s mood and meaning.”</p><ul><li>Human judges who read short translated passages without referring to the original texts, preferred TransAgents’ output, on average, to that of human translators and GPT-4 Turbo, though more for fantasy romance novels (which they preferred 77.8 percent of the time) than science fiction (which they preferred 39.1 percent of the time).&nbsp;</li><li>GPT-4 Turbo, which did refer to the original texts while comparing TransAgents’ translations with the work of human translators and its own translations, also preferred TransAgents on average.&nbsp;</li><li>TransAgents’ outputs were not word-by-word translations of the inputs but less-precise interpretations. Accordingly, it fared poorly on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2020.tacl-1.47.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RMXWGsKy0WW01ALuV3mCHajvIKy9s9v2oeXw5xXoB2OH_ZKtd52TGYLG9e1arEzrz0A2t\" rel=\"noopener\">d-BLEU</a>, a traditional measure that compares a translation to a reference text (higher is better) by comparing sequences of words. TransAgents achieved a d-BLEU score of 25, well below GPT-4 Turbo's 47.8 and Google Translate's 47.3.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;While machine translation of ordinary text and conversations has made great strides in the era of LLMs, literary translation remains a frontier. An agentic workflow that breaks down the task into subtasks and delegates them to separate LLM instances makes the task more manageable and appears to produce results that appeal to human judges (and an LLM as well). That said, this is preliminary work that suggests a need for new ways to measure the quality of literary translations.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-agents-can-improve-llm-performance/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RMXWGsKy0WW01ALuV3mCHajvIKy9s9v2oeXw5xXoB2OH_ZKtd52TGYLG9e1arEzrz0A2t\" rel=\"noopener\">Agentic workflows</a>&nbsp;raise pressing research questions: What is the best way to divide a task for different agents to tackle? How much does the specific prompt at each stage affect the final output? Good answers to questions like this will lead to powerful applications.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd0VfPtBoW-2h4NxMLp8RfR2JwNH7XZt26pE-hiy4iFvnPfbA/viewform?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/08/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-08-13T105325.070.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-08-13T105325.070.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-08-13T105325.070.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/08/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-08-13T105325.070.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/08/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-08-13T105325.070.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Are you an experienced developer?
