As I discussed the state of AI with students, technologists, executives, and government officials, something struck me: Around the world, everyone is wrestling with similar AI-related issues.</em></p><p><em>In every country:</em></p><ul><li><em>Business leaders are asking how AI will affect their companies.</em></li><li><em>Governments are wondering how it will affect the labor market, what risks it poses, and how to regulate it.</em></li><li><em>Companies are trying to figure out how to use it without “giving away” their data to one of the platform vendors.</em></li><li><em>Developers are experimenting with creative uses of generative AI. The two most common applications remain building customer service chatbots and answering questions based on documents. But I also heard about numerous creative projects in medical records, financial records, privacy protection, and much more.</em></li></ul><p><em>When the deep learning revolution started about a decade ago, I advised teams to (i) learn about the technology, (ii) start small and build projects quickly to hone intuition about what’s possible, and (iii) use learnings from smaller projects to scale to bigger ones. With the generative AI revolution, my advice remains the same. This time, though, the barrier to entry is lower and thus the time-to-value seems to be shorter. It takes substantial effort to collect data and train and deploy a neural network, but less effort to prompt a large language model and start getting results.</em></p><p><em>For developers, this means richer opportunities than ever! Leaders are looking for helpful perspectives. If you’re able to experiment, learn, identify successful use cases (and even some failures — which is fine, too), and share your insights with colleagues, perhaps you can influence the trajectory of your business.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/08/unnamed--41--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/unnamed--41--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/unnamed--41--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/08/unnamed--41--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Last Friday, I discussed how businesses can plan for generative AI with Erik Brynjolfsson, Andrew McAfee, James Milin, and Daniel Rock, who co-founded <a href=\"https://www.workhelix.com/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8dtQuCjlp59FsgsYn-DgvS4QyGr5PdKLztK6akB0rFc6PzCXq8-7rXlFQbG7-v3N3e0gBI\" rel=\"noopener\">Workhelix</a> (a portfolio company of AI Fund, which I lead).

Which of these tasks can take advantage of AI to make a radiologist’s job more productive and enjoyable? Can it help optimize image acquisition (perhaps by tuning the X-ray machine controls), speed up interpretation of images, or generate takeaways text for patients?</em></p><p><em>Although Workhelix is applying this recipe at scale, it’s also useful for teams that are exploring opportunities in AI. Consider not jobs but their component tasks. Are any of them amenable to automation or assistance by AI? This can be a helpful framework for brainstorming interesting project ideas.</em></p><p><em>The way generative AI is taking off in many places around the world means that our markets are increasingly global. Wherever in the world you live, this is a wonderful time to build your AI knowledge and increase your AI skills. Exciting opportunities lie ahead!</em></p><p><em>Special thanks to Ian Park of the Korean Investment Corporation, Chong Yap Seng of the National University of Singapore, and Yuji Mano of Mitsui, who made my visits much more productive and enjoyable.

Its 10-day forecasts outperformed those of conventional and deep-learning methods.</p><p><strong>GNN basics:</strong> A GNN processes input in the form of a graph made up of nodes connected by edges. It uses a vanilla neural network to update the representation of each node based on those of neighboring nodes. For example, nodes can represent customers and products while edges represent purchases, or — as in this work — nodes can represent local weather while edges represent connections between locations.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Short-term changes in the weather in a given location depend on conditions in nearby areas. A graph can reflect these relationships using information drawn from a high-resolution weather map, where each node represents an area’s weather and edges connect nearby areas. However, longer-term changes in the weather depend on conditions in both nearby and distant areas. To reflect relationships between more distant areas, the graph can draw on a lower-resolution map, which connects areas at greater distances. Combining edges drawn from higher- and lower-resolution weather maps produces a graph that reflects relationships among both nearby and distant areas, making it suitable for longer-term predictions.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> GraphCast produced graphs based on high- and low-resolution weather maps and processed them using three GNNs called the encoder, processor, and decoder.

Given a set of weather conditions and a set of weather conditions measured 6 hours previously for all locations on Earth, GraphCast learned to predict the weather 6 hours in the future and multiples thereof.</p><ul><li>The authors divided a map of Earth into areas 0.25 by 0.25 degrees to make a graph — actually a grid — with roughly 1 million nodes, each containing over 200 values (for conditions such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, precipitation, and so on) measured at a given time and 6 hours earlier. The nodes were connected at their northern, southern, eastern, and western borders.</li><li>The authors created a new graph by connecting each node of the grid to a smaller graph of around 41,000 nodes, where each node covered a larger region and nearby regions were connected via edges. (Specifically, the smaller graph’s nodes and edges coincided with those of a sphere divided into roughly 82,000 equilateral triangles. The authors connected nodes in the grid to those in the smaller graph if, when the two graphs were overlaid, the distance between them did not exceed a threshold.) Given the smaller graph, the encoder GNN learned to compute an embedding for each node.</li><li>To produce a multi-resolution graph, the authors represented Earth as an icosahedron (12 nodes and 20 equilateral triangles) and iteratively divided each triangle into 4 more triangles. They did this 6 times, creating 6 additional graphs of between 12 and roughly 10,000 nodes. They superimposed these graphs’ edges over the 41,000-node graph. Given the multi-resolution graph, the processor GNN learned to update the 41,000 node embeddings.</li><li>To return the resolution to 0.25 by 0.25 degrees, the authors created yet another graph by connecting the 41,000 nodes to their corresponding locations among the 1 million nodes on the initial grid. (Specifically, for each grid node, they found the triangular face that would contain it if the grid and 41,000-node graph were overlaid. Then they connected the grid node to the 3 nodes that formed this triangle.) Given this graph, the decoder GNN learned to compute the change in weather conditions for each node on the grid.</li><li>To predict the next time step, the authors added the decoder’s output to the values at the current time step. To forecast further into the future, they repeated the process, predicting the next time step based on the previously predicted values.</li><li>The system learned to predict the values at the next time step by minimizing the mean squared error between its predictions and actual measurements in 6-hour increments up to three days in advance (that is, over 12 sequential forecasts).</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Using 2018 data, the authors compared GraphCast’s 10-day forecasts to those of a popular European <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Forecast_System?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8dtQuCjlp59FsgsYn-DgvS4QyGr5PdKLztK6akB0rFc6PzCXq8-7rXlFQbG7-v3N3e0gBI\" rel=\"noopener\">system</a> that predicts weather based on differential equations that describe atmospheric physics. Compared to actual measurements, GraphCast achieved a lower root mean squared error in 90 percent of predictions. It produced a 10-day forecast at 0.25-degree resolution in under 60 seconds using a single TPU v4 chip, while the European system, which forecasts at 0.1-degree resolution, needed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00469?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8dtQuCjlp59FsgsYn-DgvS4QyGr5PdKLztK6akB0rFc6PzCXq8-7rXlFQbG7-v3N3e0gBI\" rel=\"noopener\">150 to 240 hours</a> on a supercomputer. GraphCast also outperformed Pangu-Weather, a transformer-based method, in 99.2 percent of predictions.</p><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> GraphCast’s predictions tended to be closer to average weather conditions, and it performed worse when the weather included extreme temperatures or storms.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Given a graph that combines multiple spatial resolutions, GNN can compute the influence of weather over large distances using relatively little memory and computation. This sort of graph structure may benefit other applications that process large inputs such as ultra-high resolution photos, fluid dynamics, and cosmological data.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> When it comes to forecasting weather, it looks like deep learning is the raining champ.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-workera\">A MESSAGE FROM WORKERA</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://workera.ai/blog/learning-velocity-competitive-advantage?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/08/LearningVelocity_July2023_V2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1202\" height=\"681\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/LearningVelocity_July2023_V2.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/LearningVelocity_July2023_V2.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/08/LearningVelocity_July2023_V2.png 1202w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>The best defense against disruption is your ability to take advantage of innovation.
