Some important techniques are:</em></p><ul><li><em><em>Explainability. If an AI can explain its decisions, this helps to build trust or identify problems before they can impinge on trust. For instance, the New York State Department of Financial Services is <a href=\"https://medium.com/@nydfs/building-a-fairer-and-more-inclusive-financial-services-industry-for-everyone-917183dae954?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--cNbDZv2LRN84vpVoLXvNAEvwmCG3XoOlzRePvIxCDF7IqkZ-Wtp5JZd1LY1ruiLy6d5Nj\" rel=\" noopener\">investigating</a> whether the Apple/Goldman Sachs credit card exhibits gender bias in setting credit limits. If the algorithm could explain its decisions, we could determine whether such bias was driving them.</em></em></li><li><em><em>Testing. Many of us are willing to take medicinal drugs whose biochemical effects no one fully understands. We trust these drugs because they have passed randomized clinical trials and received FDA approval. Similarly, black-box AI algorithms might gain our trust by undergoing rigorous testing.</em></em></li><li><em><em>Boundary conditions. Clearly specifying boundary conditions (where the AI is expected to work) also helps. For instance, machine learning engineers developing systems to read medical images may specify the allowable range of inputs (for instance, X-rays must be this bright, and with a certain resolution) and so we can test against these conditions.</em></em></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/Andrew-Trust-the-Robot-Sweatshirt-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Andrew Ng holding a sweatshirt that says &quot;Trust the robot&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"576\" height=\"324\"></figure><ul><li><em><em>Gradual rollout. Rather than having AI make fully automated decisions on Day One, we can start by allowing it merely to assist humans. For example, an AI trained to read X-rays might assist radiologists in making diagnoses rather than replacing doctors outright. Over time, having collected enough data and improved image readers sufficiently, we would come to trust higher and higher levels of automation, perhaps even full automation.</em></em></li><li><em><em>Auditing. Third-party audits would build trust that our algorithms have minimal or no gender, race, or other bias, and that they meet certain performance standards.</em></em></li><li><em><em>Monitors and alarms. Even after deploying a system, we can make sure we receive alerts if something goes wrong. By designing mechanisms that escalate serious issues, we can ensure that problems are fixed in a timely way.</em></em></li></ul><p><em>Trust isn’t just about convincing others that our solution works.

AI is helping those arrays stay in focus.<br><br><strong>What happened:</strong> Heliogen, a solar-thermal startup, developed a computer vision setup that tracks hundreds of mirrors at once. The system detects reflectors that go off kilter and adjusts them to concentrate sunlight. The system recently heated a boiler to 1,000 degrees Celsius, a temperature that allows for industrial processes. Serial entrepreneur and Heliogen founder Bill T. Gross delivers his pitch in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EKx7aEzXb0&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--cNbDZv2LRN84vpVoLXvNAEvwmCG3XoOlzRePvIxCDF7IqkZ-Wtp5JZd1LY1ruiLy6d5Nj\" rel=\" noopener\">video</a>.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> A solar-thermal plant's central feature is a tower topped by a boiler. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of mirrors encircle the tower. By focusing heat on the boiler, they produce steam, which spins a turbine, generating electricity. However, factors like wind, ground subsidence, and natural warping can cause mirrors to drift out of focus, reducing the plant’s efficiency. Heliogen's system calibrates them automatically.</p><ul><li>Heliogen’s tower contains a plate designed to conduct heat for use in industrial processes like smelting steel and making concrete.</li><li>Four cameras around the plate monitor the corners of each mirror. If light reflected by a corner is brighter than the center, the system sends a message to servo controllers to adjust the mirror accordingly.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> 1,000 degrees Celsius is a milestone; most solar-thermal plants reach half that temperature. But the company’s goal is 1,500 degrees. At this temperature, it’s possible to split atmospheric carbon dioxide and water into their constituent molecules of hydrogen and carbon. Heliogen aims to start by producing hydrogen to generate power via fuel cells. Ultimately, it aims to recombine hydrogen and carbon into hydrocarbon fuels — no fossils required.<br><br><strong><strong>Yes, but:</strong> </strong>A <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2019/11/22/heliogen-is-bill-gates-latest-venture-that-is-only-good-for-oil-gas-part-1/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--cNbDZv2LRN84vpVoLXvNAEvwmCG3XoOlzRePvIxCDF7IqkZ-Wtp5JZd1LY1ruiLy6d5Nj\" rel=\" noopener\">two</a>-<a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2019/11/23/heliogen-is-bill-gates-latest-venture-that-is-only-good-for-oil-gas-part-2/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--cNbDZv2LRN84vpVoLXvNAEvwmCG3XoOlzRePvIxCDF7IqkZ-Wtp5JZd1LY1ruiLy6d5Nj\" rel=\" noopener\">part</a> critique published by the news website <em>CleanTechnica</em> points out that Heliogen’s technology produces a hot spot high above ground, where the heat isn’t immediately useful and is difficult to transport. Moreover, industrial facilities would need to be very nearby, potentially casting shadows over the mirrors. “I think it’s more likely that Heliogen's core machine learning innovation regarding halo focusing will find a completely different niche outside of concentrated solar,” the author concludes.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Heliogen has intriguing technology, a seasoned leader, and a high-profile backer in Bill Gates. It's exciting to see AI helping to make cheaper, cleaner alternatives to highly polluting industrial processes.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/Bias-Resilience-SIZED.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Information related to Bias-Resilient Neural Network (BR-Net)\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"576\" height=\"324\"></figure><h2 id=\"bias-fighter\">Bias Fighter</h2><p>Sophisticated models trained on biased data can learn discriminatory patterns, which leads to skewed decisions.

In the training data, we can label, say, race and gender (known as bias variables), and BR-Net will learn to prevent spurious correlations between those variables and the model's output classification.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Biases in data correlate with class labels. If one part of a network learns to predict this correlation, another can learn to minimize the predicted correlation. This adversarial scheme can mitigate bias.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> BR-Net comprises three neural networks. The feature extractor finds embeddings of input data. The classifier predicts class labels from the embeddings. The bias predictor predicts the correlation between embeddings and bias variables. Once labels for bias variables have been added to the data, training proceeds in three steps:</p><ul><li>First, the system maximizes classification accuracy: The feature extractor and classifier together learn to predict labels.</li><li>Then it identifies the effects of bias variables: The bias predictor learns the correlation between embeddings and bias variables.</li><li>Finally, it minimizes the influence of bias: The feature extractor learns to generate embeddings that don’t correlate with the bias variables’ labels.</li><li>By iterating through these steps, the feature extractor generates embeddings that maximize the classifier’s performance and minimize the biased correlation between embeddings and labels.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers used a VGG16 classifier with BR-Net to predict a person’s gender from a photo. They trained the model on the GS-PPB dataset. Because classifiers often perform poorly on darker faces, they labeled skin tone as a bias variable. BR-Net achieved 96.1 percent balanced accuracy (accuracy for each of six skin tones considered equally), an improvement of 2 percent. This indicates more consistent results across different skin colors than a VGG16 trained without BR-Net.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Bias in AI is insidious and difficult to prevent. BR-Net offers a solution when sources of bias are known.<br><br><strong>We're thinking:</strong> Machine learning presents hard questions to society: Which biases should we avoid? How can we come to agreement about which to avoid? Who gets to decide in the end? In lieu of answers, the choices are in the hands of ML engineers.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/Nazca-SIZED-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Ancient geoglyph analysed by AI \" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"576\" height=\"324\"></figure><h2 id=\"prehistoric-pictures-rediscovered\">Prehistoric Pictures Rediscovered</h2><p>Image analysis guided by AI revealed a 2,000-year-old picture dug into the Peruvian desert.<br><br><strong>What happened:</strong> Researchers analyzing aerial imagery shot over Peru <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/11/nasca-lines-geoglyphs/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--cNbDZv2LRN84vpVoLXvNAEvwmCG3XoOlzRePvIxCDF7IqkZ-Wtp5JZd1LY1ruiLy6d5Nj\" rel=\" noopener\">found</a> a pattern that looks like a three-horned humanoid holding a staff.

The sprawling patterns are visible only from higher elevations.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Using manual methods, researchers at Yamagata University found more than 100 geoglyphs in satellite photos and other imagery from the region of southeastern Peru called the Nazca Pampa. But they had collected too much data from surrounding areas to search manually.

The team reviewed the candidates manually.

They made these shapes by removing the top layer of pebbles to expose lighter-colored clay roughly six inches below.

Recent work by Facebook AI Research and Université de Lorraine’s computer science research lab addresses this problem.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Angela Fan and collaborators developed a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08435?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--cNbDZv2LRN84vpVoLXvNAEvwmCG3XoOlzRePvIxCDF7IqkZ-Wtp5JZd1LY1ruiLy6d5Nj\" rel=\" noopener\">model</a> for multi-document summarization and question answering. While most previous efforts combine all input documents into one, the authors improved  the state of t he art by representing them in a more compact form.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> The combined length of major source documents pertaining to a given topic overwhelms current language models' ability to extract meaning. A knowledge graph squeezes out irrelevant and redundant information, enabling models to work more effectively.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors’ method involves three steps: constructing a knowledge graph from source documents, encoding the graph as a sequence of words, and extracting information from the sequence.</p><ul><li>The model reads a set of source documents and converts each sentence into a (subject, object, relationship) triplet. It transforms each triplet into two nodes corresponding to the subject and object plus an edge between them that represents their relationship. Nodes and edges also capture the number of times a given subject, object, or relationship appears, reducing redundancy.</li><li>For each word, a word embedding encodes meaning and a position embedding encodes relative position. A graph-weight embedding captures the number of times a node or edge appears and a query-relevance embedding reflects a given source document’s relevance to the latest input query. These embeddings combine to yield the vector representation of the graph.</li><li>The model flattens the graph by concatenating triplets.</li><li>At this point, the input is much smaller but still large. A modified attention mechanism finds the most salient parts of the graph and focuses there while generating output text.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors tested their model on a question answering task based on the dataset called Explain Like I'm Five (ELI5).This dataset contains 270,000 question-answer pairs along with source documents (the top 100 web sources from the CommonCrawl corpus for each question). The graph approach edged out the earlier state of the art on F1 for ROUGE-1 (30 percent versus 28.9 percent). They also compared performance on the WikiSum dataset for multi-document summarization using an article’s title as the input query, the footnotes as source documents, and the first paragraph as the target summary. The graph approach underperformed the previous ROUGE-L state of the art 36.5 percent to 38.8 percent, but the comparison wasn't apples-to-apples. The previous research supplemented the corpus with a web search, while the new work used only CommonCrawl. <br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This research shows that natural language generation based on very large bodies of input text can work well. It also shows that source documents don’t need to be composed of well formed sentences. New ways of representing source documents may well lead to better language generation.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Many search engines produce summaries or answer questions by choosing the most relevant document. The ability to draw on any number of documents could enable such models to deliver a far wider diversity of information, leading to better research tools and ultimately a better-informed public.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/Sedol-SIZED.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"AlphaGo playing Go with Lee Sedol\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"576\" height=\"324\"></figure><h2 id=\"is-ai-making-mastery-obsolete\">Is AI Making Mastery Obsolete?</h2><p>Is there any reason to continue playing games that AI has mastered?

Although he didn’t retire, Kasparov did accuse IBM’s engineers of cheating. He later retracted the charge, and in 2017 wrote a book <a href=\"http://www.kasparov.com/garry-kasparov-says-ai-can-make-us-more-human-pcmag-interview-march-20th-2019/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--cNbDZv2LRN84vpVoLXvNAEvwmCG3XoOlzRePvIxCDF7IqkZ-Wtp5JZd1LY1ruiLy6d5Nj\" rel=\" noopener\">arguing</a> that, if humans can overcome their feelings of being threatened by AI, they can learn from it. The book advocates an augmented intelligence in which humans and machines work together to solve problems.<br><br><strong>The human element:</strong> Although AlphaGo won in the 2016 duel, its human opponent still managed to shine. During the fourth match, Sedol made a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/03/two-moves-alphago-lee-sedol-redefined-future/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--cNbDZv2LRN84vpVoLXvNAEvwmCG3XoOlzRePvIxCDF7IqkZ-Wtp5JZd1LY1ruiLy6d5Nj\" rel=\" noopener\">move</a> so unconventional it defied AlphaGo’s expectation and led to his sole victory.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Lee wasn't defeated by a machine alone. He was beaten by a machine built by humans under the direction of AlphaGo research lead David Silver. Human mastery is obsolete only if you ignore people like Silver and his team.</p>","comment_id":"61005ad897b0400048294736","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/Andrew-Trust-the-Robot-Sweatshirt-2.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2021-07-27T12:13:28.000-07:00","updated_at":"2022-10-07T14:28:32.000-07:00","published_at":"2019-12-04T12:00:00.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"Recently I wrote about major reasons why AI projects fail, such as small data, robustness, and change management.
