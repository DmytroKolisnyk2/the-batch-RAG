New research demonstrates a more frugal variation.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Nikita Kitaev, Lukasz Kaiser, and Anselm Levskaya at UC Berkeley and Google modified the transformer architecture to run faster while requiring orders of magnitude less memory during training. They call the new version <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Reformer</a>.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> The transformer architecture is inherently inefficient: It tracks relationships among all input tokens, whether or not they matter to the output, and training requires a lot of memory. A few simple tweaks can rein in these excesses.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers replaced the transformer’s feed-forward network with a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04585?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">reversible residual network</a>. They modified the attention mechanism with <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/~andoni/LSH/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">locality-sensitive hashing</a>.</p><ul><li>Typically, a transformer must keep all feed-forward layers in memory during training. In Reformer, each layer of the reversible residual network stores information that enables backpropagation to occur one layer at a time, rather than storing information about the entire network. That way, the network requires only enough memory to store one layer.</li><li>A transformer’s attention mechanism encodes relationships between the current token and previous tokens, but usually only a few are important. Locality-sensitive hashing sorts the previous tokens into buckets according to similarity. Then Reformer computes attention relationships only within buckets.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors ran experiments on Wikipedia <a href=\"https://cs.fit.edu/~mmahoney/compression/textdata.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">text</a> parceled into sequences of 64,000 tokens (more than double the number in the original transformer <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">paper</a>) in 16GB of memory. Reformer achieved almost the same performance as a transformer with an identical number of parameters while consuming less memory. Furthermore, the time required to compute LSH attention scaled more efficiently with increased sequence length.<br><br><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Researchers seeking better performance are pumping up transformer-based models to immense sizes — Microsoft’s latest language model has <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">17 billion parameters</a>. Running such behemoths can be out of reach for all but the largest corporate research labs. Reformer offers a more efficient alternative.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Reformer’s improvements equip the transformer architecture for reading and generating long sequences — not only text, but also long-form video and audio. This capability could lead to larger-scale benchmarks to propel transformers into new tasks.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-optimize207.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Functioning of system that trackes the productivity of industrial workers\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"eyes-on-the-assembly-line\">Eyes on the Assembly Line</h3><p>AI may not steal your job, but it can tell the boss when you’re slacking.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Drishti, a startup based in Palo Alto and Bengaluru, tracks the productivity of industrial workers by recognizing their actions on the assembly line.

New research enables self-driving cars to identify such stable indicators on their own.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Dan Barnes and Ingmar Posner of Oxford University built a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10789?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">model</a> that extracts landmarks on the fly from radar scans to build maps for autonomous vehicles. Radar is challenging in this application because it generates noise and ghost images, but it has the benefits of long range, high refresh rate, and robustness to environmental conditions. This <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-PO7nxWpJU&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">video</a> explains.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Self-driving cars often navigate by recognizing landmarks. The researchers realized that neural networks can discover them by reversing the task: The radar signals most valuable to navigation are likely stable features of the landscape.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The system learns to identify keypoints that best predict a car’s motion. The training <a href=\"https://ori.ox.ac.uk/oxford-radar-robotcar-dataset/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">data</a> specifies a vehicle’s motion from radar frame to radar frame.</p><ul><li>A U-Net architecture transforms each radar frame into potentially useful keypoints.

It uses the differences in their positions to predict the car’s motion. The keypoints that are most useful in performing this task are likely to be stable.</li><li>Using the description vector, the system can match keypoints from different perspectives. This enables it to map loops in a route, a challenging problem for earlier methods that process entire radar frames rather than keypoints.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The system’s error in predicting the car’s position after driving a fixed distance was 2.06 percent, compared to the previous state of the art, 3.72 percent. Similarly, the error in the car’s predicted orientation fell from 0.0141 to 0.0067 degrees per meter driven. The new system ran an order of magnitude faster. For routes that didn’t include a loop, an earlier <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03752.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">whole-frame approach</a> cut the predicted position error to 1.59 percent and rotation error to 0.0044 degrees per meter.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The ability to generate keypoints automatically is making waves in other <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10750?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">computer</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11883?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">vision</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02027?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">tasks</a>.
