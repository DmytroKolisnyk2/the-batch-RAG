More than 40 cities in Canada and the U.S. have used its analyses.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The usual approach to monitoring traffic safety identifies dangerous intersections based on crashes that already have occurred. Considering close calls brings previously unidentified trouble spots to light.</p><ul><li>MicroTraffic uses computer vision to identify motor vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians, and scooters in traffic-cam videos. Its system flags moments when a vehicle came close to colliding with something. The algorithm grades risk based on speed, angle, and the types of vehicles and other objects involved.</li><li>The company provides city planners with data that show the rate of near misses at each intersection.

But some examples are more useful for learning than others. A new approach lets models distinguish between them.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers Zhongzheng Ren, Raymond A. Yeh, and Alexander G. Schwing from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign developed an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01293v1.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">algorithm</a> that weighs the most significant examples more heavily.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> In its most common form, semi-supervised learning tries to minimize a weighted combination of supervised and unsupervised losses. Most previous approaches effectively weight each unlabeled example as equally important. The authors, instead of assigning one weight to all unlabeled examples, calculate weights for every example automatically by evaluating how it changes the model’s output during training.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The algorithm works with any semi-supervised model. It trains by alternating between optimizing the model and the per-example weights.</p><ul><li>First, the authors trained the model on the training set while keeping the per-example weights fixed.</li><li>Then they trained the per-example weights on the validation set while keeping the model parameters fixed.</li><li>The authors derived an influence function to calculate the gradient of the validation loss. This function measures how changing the weight assigned to an unlabeled training example affects the model parameters.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Using synthetic data, the authors demonstrated that less useful examples were assigned lower weights. In image classification using the <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.222.9220&rep=rep1&type=pdf&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Cifar-10</a> and <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/37648.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">SVHN</a> datasets, their approach marginally outperformed previous state of the art semi-supervised learning work including <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07685?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">FixMatch</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12848?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">UDA</a>.

The company argues that photorealistic images of people who don’t exist (like the portraits above, generated by thispersondoesnotexist.com), along with manipulation of images of people who do, have tremendous commercial potential despite their reputation for making mischief.<br><br><strong>The bright side:</strong> The paper argues that what it calls deepfake synthesis — the basket of AI techniques capable of synthesizing realistic human faces, voices, and bodies, as well as other objects — could yield a range of economic and social benefits. It’s already being applied for legitimate purposes:</p><ul><li>Deepfake technology has been used in the movie industry to produce <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2015/10/20/9577863/furious-7-used-350-cgi-shots-of-paul-walker?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">body doubles</a> of deceased actors and to match motions of an <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/ai-dubbing-david-beckham-multilingual-1203309213/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">actor’s mouth</a> to voiceovers in various languages.</li><li>It has fueled the rise of apps that let users alter their own appearance or swap faces, such as <a href=\"https://www.faceapp.com/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">FaceAPP</a> and <a href=\"https://zaodownload.com/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Zao</a>.</li><li>E-commerce companies are using similar tools to provide shoppers with virtual views of themselves wearing different outfits.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.projectrevoice.org/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Project Revoice</a> uses neural sound synthesis to re-create the voices of people who no longer can speak due to conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.</li></ul><p><strong>Beyond fakery:</strong> The company’s vision for AI isn’t just about digital doppelgangers. The paper argues that techniques like few-shot learning and offline reinforcement learning could drive broader commercialization in disciplines like natural computer vision, language processing, and voice recognition. The company also looks to AI to help improve crop yields and balance energy demand.<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Tencent has a vested interest in promoting AI.

Its plans influence the direction of technology as well the attitudes of regulators who would bind it. Its push to commercialize deepfakes could open new markets — and thorny issues — for the AI community.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Deepfakes have potential uses in online education, such as enabling an instructor on video to deliver a course in any number of languages.

They recognize that the difference doesn’t disturb their knowledge of how to drive. Similarly, a new reinforcement learning method manages superficial variations in the environment without re-training.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Nicklas Hansen led a UC Berkeley group in developing <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04309?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Policy Adaptation during Deployment</a> (Pad), which allows agents trained by any RL method to adjust for visual changes that don’t impact the optimal action.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Deep reinforcement learning agents often learn to extract important features of the environment and then choose the optimal course of action based on those features. The researchers designed a self-supervised training task that updates a feature extractor to account for environmental changes without disturbing the strategy for selecting actions.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> In most agents, a feature extractor captures visual information about the environment while a controller decides on actions. A change in the surroundings — say, from day to night — causes the feature extractor to derive different features, which can confuse the controller. Pad, once it’s deployed and no longer receives rewards, continues to update the feature extractor while leaving the controller unaffected. Thus the agent learns to use the same strategy regardless of environmental changes.</p><ul><li>Pad uses an inverse dynamics network to make the correct adjustments without receiving a reward. This network decides which action caused a transition from one state to the next. In a self-driving car, for example, it would predict that the steering wheel turned left when the car transitions from the middle lane to the left lane.</li><li>During training, the feature extractor learns features from the controller’s loss. The inverse dynamics network learns environmental mechanics from the extracted features. This task is self-supervised; the agent keeps track of where it was, what it did, and where it ended up.</li><li>At deployment, with a new environment and without rewards, the inverse dynamics network continues to learn. Its output updates the feature extractor, encouraging the extractor to adapt to small visual changes. The updated extractor should produce similar features for the new environment as the original version did for the training environment.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers evaluated Pad by training an agent via the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">soft actor-critic</a> method, then substituting a plain-color background with a video at test time. On the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00690?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">DeepMind Control Suite</a>, which includes motor-control tasks such as walking, Pad improved the soft actor-critic baseline in the new environment on seven of eight tasks.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> If the environment doesn’t change, Pad hurts performance (albeit minimally).<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> To be useful in the real world, reinforcement learning agents must handle the transition from simulated to physical environments and cope gracefully with changes of scenery after they’ve been deployed. While all roads have similar layouts, their backgrounds may differ substantially, and your self-driving car should keep its eyes on the road. Similarly, a personal-assistant robot shouldn’t break down if you paint your walls.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> <a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/the-batch-deepmind-masters-starcraft-2-ai-attacks-on-amazon-a-career-in-robot-management-banks-embrace-bots?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Robustness</a> is a major challenge to deploying machine learning: The data we need to operate on is often different than the data available for training.
