These problems are distinct from the issues that arise in building traditional software. They include </em><a href=\"https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/developing-ai-products-part-2-how-to-assess-technical-feasibility/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><em>unclear technical feasibility</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/developing-ai-products-part-3-coping-with-product-specification/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><em>complex product specification</em></a><em>. A further challenge is the need for data to start development.</em></p><p><em>To develop a traditional software product, interviews with potential users might be sufficient to scope out a desirable product, after which you can jump into writing the code. But AI systems require both code and data. If you have an idea for, say, automating the processing of medical records or optimizing logistics networks, you need medical records data or logistics data to train a model. Where can you get it?</em></p><p><em>I see different answers for consumer-facing and business-facing AI products. For consumer-facing (B2C) products, it is generally easier to ask a small group of alpha testers to try out a product and provide data. This may be sufficient to bootstrap the development process. If the data you need is generic to many users — for example, photos on smartphones — it’s also more likely that a team will be able to find or acquire enough data to get started.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-20-at-9.27.43-PM-copy.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Series of spreadsheets with different data\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-20-at-9.27.43-PM-copy.png 600w\"></figure><p><em>For business-facing (B2B) AI projects, it’s often difficult to get the data necessary to build a prototype because a lot of highly specialized data is locked up within the companies that produce it. I’ve seen a couple of general ways in which AI teams get around this problem.</em></p><ul><li><em>Some AI teams start by doing NRE (non-recurring engineering, or consulting) work, in which they build highly customized solutions for a handful of customers. This approach doesn’t scale, but you can use it to obtain enough data to learn the lessons or train the models needed to build a repeatable business. Given their need for data, AI startups seem to take this path more often than traditional software startups.</em></li><li><em>Some AI entrepreneurs have worked with multiple companies in a vertical market. For example, someone who has worked for a large public cloud company may have exposure to data from multiple companies in a given industry and witnessed similar issues play out in multiple companies. I’ve also had friends in academia who consulted for multiple companies, which enabled them to recognize patterns and come up with general solutions. Experience like this puts entrepreneurs in a better position to build a nascent product that helps them approach companies that can provide data.</em></li></ul><p><em>If you lack data to get started on an AI project, these tactics can help you get an initial dataset. Once you’ve built a product, it becomes easier to find customers, get access to even more data, and scale up from there.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!<br><br>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h2 id=\"news\">News</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/Brain-Implant.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Animated video showing a system to interpret electrical impulses from the brain as words \" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/Brain-Implant.gif 600w\"></figure><h2 id=\"listening-to-the-brain\">Listening to the Brain</h2><p>Neural networks translated a paralyzed man’s brainwaves into conversational phrases.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley trained a <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2027540?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8mEbawcEmzncjxDwhK1DAGR7Sn8cwjQTIRQgDJz50TbRjyLAN_FkjS67fK53BRWMrbsIER\">system</a> to interpret electrical impulses from the brain of a man who had lost the ability to speak 15 years ago, and displayed them as words on a video screen.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers implanted an array of 128 electrodes into the region of the brain responsible for movement of the mouth, lips, jaw, tongue, and larynx.

New research enables a single trained network to generate 3D reconstructions of multiple scenes.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Adam Kosiorek and Heiko Strathmann led a team at DeepMind in developing <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00587?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8mEbawcEmzncjxDwhK1DAGR7Sn8cwjQTIRQgDJz50TbRjyLAN_FkjS67fK53BRWMrbsIER\">NeRF-VAE</a>. Given several 2D views of a 3D scene pictured in its training data, NeRF-VAE produces new views of the scene.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> The method known as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8mEbawcEmzncjxDwhK1DAGR7Sn8cwjQTIRQgDJz50TbRjyLAN_FkjS67fK53BRWMrbsIER\">Neural Radiance Fields</a> (NeRF) produces new views of a scene based on existing views and the positions and orientations of the camera that produced them. NeRF-VAE takes the same input but adds representations of those views. This enables it to learn patterns within a scene. Those patterns help the network produce new views by enabling it to, say, infer the characteristics of common elements that were partly blocked from view in the training images.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> NeRF-VAE is a modified <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8mEbawcEmzncjxDwhK1DAGR7Sn8cwjQTIRQgDJz50TbRjyLAN_FkjS67fK53BRWMrbsIER\">variational autoencoder</a> (VAE), where the encoder is a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03898?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8mEbawcEmzncjxDwhK1DAGR7Sn8cwjQTIRQgDJz50TbRjyLAN_FkjS67fK53BRWMrbsIER\">Nouveau ResNet</a> and the decoder is basically NeRF with an additional input for a representation of the scene. The training set comprised four randomly generated views per scene of 200,000 synthetic 3D scenes composed of geometric shapes against plain backgrounds, as well as the associated camera positions and orientations. The authors trained the network to match predicted pixels with the pixels in the images.</p><ul><li>For each of the four views of a scene, the encoder predicts parameter values that correspond to the image’s data distribution. The system averages the parameters and uses the average distribution to generate a representation of the scene.</li><li>The decoder samples points along rays that extends from the camera through each pixel in the views. It uses a vanilla neural network to compute the color and transparency of each point based on the point’s position and the ray’s direction as well as the scene representation.</li><li>To determine the color of a given pixel, it combines the color and transparency of all sampled points along the associated ray. To generate a new view, it repeats this process for every pixel.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors trained one NeRF-VAE on all scenes and a separate NeRF for each scene. Trained on four images per scene, NeRF-VAE achieved roughly 0.2 mean squared error, while NeRF achieved roughly 0.8 mean squared error. NeRF required training on 100 images of a scene to achieve a competitive degree of error.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> NeRF falters when it attempts to visualize hidden regions in a scene. That’s partly because a NeRF model encodes information about only a single 3D structure. NeRF-VAE overcomes this weakness by learning about features that are common to a variety of 3D structures.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>By feeding a random vector directly to the decoder, the authors produced views of novel, generated scenes made up of elements in the training images. Could this approach extend deepfakery into the third dimension?</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/07/openai.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Forbidden sign over a robot's hand solving a Rubik's Cube\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"576\" height=\"324\"></figure><h2 id=\"bye-bye-bots\">Bye Bye Bots</h2><p>The independent research lab OpenAI wowed technology watchers in 2019 with a robotic hand that solved Rubik’s Cube.
