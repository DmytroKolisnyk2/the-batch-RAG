I was struck by how frequently startup leaders have to do things they have no expertise in.</em><br><br><em>As AI developers, every time we build a machine learning application, we might choose a neural network architecture, tune a dataset, train a model, evaluate its performance, and consider the outcome to decide what to try next. The rapid iteration cycle means we can try many combinations in a given project. Over many projects, we hone our intuitions about what works. The quick feedback and opportunity to improve are among the things that makes machine learning fun!</em><br><br><em>In contrast, hardly anyone starts 100 companies even in a long career. No one raises seed funding, builds a company culture, hires a vice president of sales, or makes an initial public offering very many times. Thus few people can become experts at performing these tasks through repeated practice.</em><br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/03/Andres-letter.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Darts board\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1199\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/Andres-letter.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/Andres-letter.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/03/Andres-letter.jpg 1199w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>That’s why I believe that the smartest startup leaders know when they need help and understand that no single person can do it all. A community of peers, each of whom has raised funding once or twice, can pool ideas and achieve better results than the typical individual. Similarly a recruiter who has hired 100 sales executives is likely to have valuable insights that someone who has done it only once or twice won’t.</em><br><br><em>Although software development allows for repeated practice, we, too, often have to do things we don’t have much experience with, because technology keeps evolving. Someone may find themselves, for the first time, deploying a real-time machine learning system, compressing a neural network to run on a low-power edge device, or calculating the return on investment in an AI project. In situations like this we, too, are stronger as a community. We can benefit from the experience of our peers who have completed the task and know something about how to go about it.</em><br><br><em>When I was younger I believed that, if only I worked and studied a bit harder, I could figure almost anything out. That attitude worked well enough for a while, but the more experience I gain, the more I realize that I need help from others. I’m grateful to the many people who have given me advice over the years, and I hope that the AI community can be a place where all of us can collaborate and support one another.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/03/CHEMWEAPONS.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Skeletal formula of the (S) enantiomer of VX\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/CHEMWEAPONS.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/CHEMWEAPONS.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/03/CHEMWEAPONS.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"ai-designs-chemical-weapons\">AI Designs Chemical Weapons</h1><p>It’s surprisingly easy to turn a well-intended machine learning model to the dark side.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> In an experiment, Fabio Urbina and colleagues at Collaborations Pharmaceuticals, who had built a drug-discovery model to design useful compounds and avoid toxic ones, retrained it to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00465-9?fbclid=IwAR11_V1cd9SUxEvUfwrWMA7TUcroyYIY1nBDUL3KaS-8B4rG5MIqZCmjm0M&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GP6IAg583Xe6_tW2XESpts6KUwmIayxjP-Tst97bJgsiD72X6-p4KSZrjNWJe9bTSId39\" rel=\"noopener\">generate poisons</a>.

Perhaps AI trained on datasets that have been curated for their relevance to a wide variety of cultures will help us come closer to this ideal.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table class=\"hse-image-wrapper\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px !important;\"><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(59, 59, 59); word-break: break-word; text-align: center; padding: 5px 0px 10px; font-size: 0px;\"><img alt=\"ezgif.com-gif-maker (19)-1\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/5871640/hubfs/ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(19)-1.gif?upscale=true&amp;width=1200&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(19)-1.gif\" width=\"600\" align=\"middle\" class=\"stretch-on-mobile\" style=\"outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width: 100%; font-size: 16px;\"></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"spot-the-bad-mutation\">Spot the Bad Mutation</h1><p>Every gene in the human genome exists in a variety of mutations, and some encode protein variants that cause cells to malfunction, resulting in illness. Yet which mutations are associated with disease is largely unknown. Can deep learning identify them?<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Jonathan Frazer, Pascal Notin, Mafalda Dias, and colleagues at Harvard Medical School and University of Oxford introduced <a href=\"https://evemodel.org/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GP6IAg583Xe6_tW2XESpts6KUwmIayxjP-Tst97bJgsiD72X6-p4KSZrjNWJe9bTSId39\" rel=\"noopener\">Evolutionary Model of Variant Effect</a> (EVE), a neural network that learned to classify disease-causing protein variants — and thus dangerous mutations — without labeled data.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Mutations that encode disease-causing proteins tend to be rare because individuals who carry them are less likely to survive to reproductive age. Thus the prevalence of a given mutation indicates its potential role in illness. Among a collection of variants on a particular protein — a protein family — each variant is produced by a distinct mutation of a particular gene. Clustering uncommon and common variants within the family can sort the mutations likely to be associated with disease.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GP6IAg583Xe6_tW2XESpts6KUwmIayxjP-Tst97bJgsiD72X6-p4KSZrjNWJe9bTSId39\" rel=\"noopener\">variational autoencoder</a> (VAE) learns to reproduce an input sequence by maximizing the likelihood that output tokens match the corresponding input tokens. In this case, the sequence is a chain of amino acids that make up a protein in a <a href=\"https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GP6IAg583Xe6_tW2XESpts6KUwmIayxjP-Tst97bJgsiD72X6-p4KSZrjNWJe9bTSId39\" rel=\"noopener\">database</a> of 250 million proteins. The authors trained a separate VAE for each protein family. Given one variant in a protein family, it learned to compute the likelihood of each amino acid in the sequence. This enabled the authors to derive the likelihood of the entire sequence.</p><ul><li>Within each protein family, the authors computed the likelihood of each variant. The authors assigned a rareness score to each variant based on the difference in likelihood between the variant and the most common version.</li><li>The authors fitted a Gaussian mixture model, which learns a number of Gaussian distributions to assign data points to clusters, to the rareness scores for all variants in a family. They generated two clusters: one each for rare and common variants.</li><li>They classified variants from the common cluster as benign and the variants from the uncommon cluster as disease-causing. They classified the 25 percent of variants that were most in-between clusters as uncertain.</li><li>Having classified a protein, they applied the same classification to the gene that encoded it.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors compared EVE’s classifications to those of 23 supervised and unsupervised models built to perform the same task. They checked the models’ classifications for <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GP6IAg583Xe6_tW2XESpts6KUwmIayxjP-Tst97bJgsiD72X6-p4KSZrjNWJe9bTSId39\" rel=\"noopener\">3,219 genes</a> for which labels are known. EVE achieved 0.92 AUC, or average area under the curve, while other methods achieved between 0.7 AUC and 0.9 AUC (higher is better). The authors also compared EVE’s output with lab tests that measure, for example, how cells that contain mutations respond to certain chemicals. EVE scored as well as or better than those tests on the five gene families in which labels are known with highest confidence. For example, for the gene known as TP53, EVE achieved 0.99 AUC while the lab test achieved 0.95 AUC.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Unsupervised clustering can substitute for labels when we have a belief about what caused certain clusters to emerge; for instance, that natural selection reduces the likelihood of disease-causing protein variants. This approach may open doors to analyze other large datasets in which labels are unavailable.<br><br><strong>We're thinking:</strong> Clustering unlabeled data and examining the clusters for insights is a tried-and-true technique. By employing VAEs to assess likelihoods, this work extends basic clustering to a wider array of problems.</p>","comment_id":"6244b4bedfed09003d788e64","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/03/Andres-letter-1.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-03-30T12:51:26.000-07:00","updated_at":"2022-10-05T14:52:38.000-07:00","published_at":"2022-03-30T13:04:50.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"AI
