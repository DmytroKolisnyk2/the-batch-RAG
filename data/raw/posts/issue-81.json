Over the years, I’ve had fun applying machine learning to manufacturing, healthcare, climate change, agriculture, ecommerce, advertising, and other industries. How can someone who’s not an expert in all these sectors find meaningful projects within them? Here are five steps to help you scope projects effectively.</em><br><br><em><strong>Step 1: Identify a business problem (not an AI problem).</strong> I like to find a domain expert and ask, “What are the top three things that you wish worked better? Why aren’t they working yet?” For example, if you want to apply AI to climate change, you might discover that power-grid operators can’t accurately predict how much power intermittent sources like wind and solar might generate in the future.</em><br><br><em><strong>Step 2: Brainstorm AI solutions.</strong> When I was younger, I used to execute on the first idea I was excited about. Sometimes this worked out okay, but sometimes I ended up missing an even better idea that might not have taken any more effort to build. Once you understand a problem, you can brainstorm potential solutions more efficiently. For instance, to predict power generation from intermittent sources, we might consider using satellite imagery to <a href=\"https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2019/5.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">map the locations of wind turbines</a> more accurately, using satellite imagery to estimate the height and generation capacity of wind turbines, or using weather data to betterpredict cloud cover and thus <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04715?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">solar irradiance</a>. Sometimes there isn’t a good AI solution, and that’s okay too.</em><br><br><em><strong>Step 3: Assess the feasibility and value of potential solutions.</strong> You can determine whether an approach is technically feasible by looking at published work, what competitors have done, or perhaps building a quick proof of concept implementation. You can determine its value by consulting with domain experts (say, power-grid operators, who can advise on the utility of the potential solutions mentioned above).</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-03-at-4.34.01-PM-copy.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"How to scope AI projects slide\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><em><strong>Step 4: Determine milestones.</strong> Once you’ve deemed a project sufficiently valuable, the next step is to determine the metrics to aim for. This includes both machine learning metrics such as accuracy and business metrics such as revenue. Machine learning teams are often most comfortable with metrics that a learning algorithm can optimize. But we may need to to stretch outside our comfort zone to come up with business metrics such as those related to user engagement, revenue, and so on. Unfortunately, not every business problem can be reduced to a matter of <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-78/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">optimizing test set accuracy</a>! If you aren’t able to determine reasonable milestones, it may be a sign that you need to learn more about the problem. A quick proof of concept can help supply the missing perspective.</em></p><p><em><strong>Step 5: Budget for resources.</strong> Think through everything you’ll need to get the project done including data, personnel, time, and any integrations or support you may need from other teams. For example, if you need funds to purchase satellite imagery, make sure that’s in the budget.</em><br><br><em>This is an iterative process. If, at any step, you find that the current direction is infeasible, return to an earlier step and proceed with your new understanding. </em><br><br><em>Is there a domain that excites you where AI might make a difference? I hope these steps will guide you in exploring it — even if you don’t yet have deep expertise in that field. AI won’t solve every problem, but as a community, let’s look for ways to make a positive impact wherever we can.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h2 id=\"news\">News</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TIMNIT.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Margaret Mitchell, Marian Croak and Timnit Gebru pictured \" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"google-overhauls-ethical-ai-team\">Google Overhauls Ethical AI Team</h2><p>Having dismissed two key researchers, Google restructured its efforts in AI ethics. <br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Marian Croak, an <a href=\"https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/journeys-innovation/audio-stories/positively-connected?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">accomplished</a> software engineer and vice president of engineering at Google, will lead a new center of expertise in responsible AI, the company <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/marian-croak-responsible-ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced</a>.

Yet researchers have used a patchwork of metrics to evaluate their performance, making them hard to compare. New work aims to level the playing field.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Yi Tay and colleagues at Google developed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04006?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Long-Range Arena</a>, a suite of benchmarks designed to standardize comparisons between transformers. The term <em>long-range</em> refers to transformers’ ability to capture dependencies between tokens in an input sequence that are far apart.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> The power of the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">original transformer</a> lies in its ability to track relationships between tokens anywhere in an input sequence. But that power comes at a cost: The model slows down and its memory requirement rises dramatically as the length of its input increases. Many variants were created to alleviate this issue. These models cry out for tests that challenge their ability over long sequences.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The suite comprises six tests designed to probe different aspects of transformer behavior.</p><ul><li>Long ListOps requires a model to calculate the numeric output from a long list of ordered operations; for instance, to determine that [MAX 4 3 [MIN 2 3 ] 1 0 [MEDIAN 1 5 8 9, 2]] equals 5. It investigates how well a model can parse long sequences.</li><li>Character-Level Text Classification is a binary sentiment classification task based on movie reviews in the <a href=\"https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IMDb</a> dataset. Its objective is to test a model’s accuracy when processing documents up to 4,000 characters long.</li><li>Character-Level Document Retrieval evaluates similarity between two documents using the <a href=\"http://clair.eecs.umich.edu/aan/networks.php?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ACL Anthology Network dataset</a>, which identifies when one paper cites another. It assesses a model’s ability to compress text inputs for comparison.</li><li>Image Classification on Sequences of Pixels classifies objects in <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CIFAR-10</a> images that have been flattened into a one-dimensional sequence. This tests how well a model learns spatial relationships between pixels.</li><li>Pathfinder and Pathfinder-X require a model to decide whether two circles are connected by a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08315?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">path</a> that consists of dashes in a generated image. Pathfinder-X increases the difficulty by making the image area 16 times larger. Both tasks test how well a model learns long-range spatial relationships. Pathfinder-X also gauges how the results change if the sequence length is much longer.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors tested 10 transformers. While some shined in one task or another, none was the clear front runner. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14062?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Big Bird</a> achieved the highest average accuracy – 55.01 percent across five tasks — but it didn’t achieve the top score in any single task. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03555?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Performer</a>, dominated character-level text classification, performing 5.7 times faster than a vanilla transformer. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04768?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Linformer</a> used the least memory, 9.58 times less than the vanilla transformer. All models failed Pathfinder-X: Their ability to classify the image was no better than random chance, showing that longer input sequences inhibited performance.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Standardized comparisons not only help application developers choose the right model for their needs, they also provide a deeper understanding of a model’s performance characteristics and spur researchers to improve the state of the art.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> You can get involved, too.
