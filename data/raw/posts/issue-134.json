AI projects can be complex, and many things can go wrong. Colleagues can alert you to issues you’ll need to address, such as difficulty gathering data, complexity of software integration, the need to reorganize workflows, how to manage the occasional incorrect prediction, as well as safety, fairness, and regulatory concerns.</em></li><li><em>Bring evidence that a machine learning system could work. You might build a quick proof of concept. Or you might find related work, either in the academic literature or reports of other companies, to persuade others that it could work for your organization, too.</em></li><li><em>Bring in outside consultants, advisors, or speakers. Their expertise can help persuade your team. (True story: I’ve met several people who have asked their non-technical teammates to take the <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">AI for Everyone</a> course. They’ve found that things move forward more easily when everyone involved has a basic business understanding of AI).</em></li><li><em>Find allies. One forward-thinking partner can make all the difference! Persuading the first person is usually the hardest part. The first can help you persuade the second, and together you can persuade the third.</em></li></ul><p><em>Throughout this process, be open to learning that your idea isn’t sound after all or that it might need to change before it can be successful. I would guess that almost every successful AI application you read about in The Batch required someone to persuade others to give machine learning a shot.</em></p><p><em>Don’t let the skeptics shut you down. Don’t give up, keep pushing, and . . . </em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table class=\"hse-image-wrapper\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px !important;\"><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(59, 59, 59); word-break: break-word; text-align: center; padding: 5px 0px 10px; font-size: 0px;\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-02-28 at 5.46.58 PM\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/5871640/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202022-02-28%20at%205.46.58%20PM.png?upscale=true&amp;width=1200&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202022-02-28%20at%205.46.58%20PM.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"middle\" class=\"stretch-on-mobile\" style=\"outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width: 100%; font-size: 16px;\"></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"clues-to-the-secret-identity-of-q\">Clues to the Secret Identity of Q</h1><p>Machine learning algorithms may have unmasked the authors behind a sprawling conspiracy theory that has had a wide-ranging impact on U.S. politics.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Two research teams analyzed social media posts to identify Q, the anonymous figure at the center of a U.S. right-wing political movement called QAnon, <em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/19/technology/qanon-messages-authors.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8F7aKjx7pUXc1DjSdziZd2YeTnRhZmsEV5AQ1WtDmgDnlMsjaP8sR5P8QESxZ220lgPmm0\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>.

Why not weather maps? A conditional GAN, which conditions its output on a specific input — say, previous weather history — could produce precipitation maps of future rainfall in short order.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Given a random input, a GAN learns to produce realistic output through competition between a discriminator that judges whether output is synthetic or real and a generator that aims to fool the discriminator. A conditional GAN works the same way but adds an input that conditions both the generator’s output and the discriminator’s judgment. The authors trained a conditional GAN, given radar images of cloud cover, to generate a series of precipitation maps that represent future rainfall.</p><ul><li>The generator took as input four consecutive radar observations recorded at five-minute intervals in the UK between 2016 and 2019. It used a series of convolutional layers to generate a representation of each and concatenated the representations. Given these observations and a random vector, a series of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06432?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8F7aKjx7pUXc1DjSdziZd2YeTnRhZmsEV5AQ1WtDmgDnlMsjaP8sR5P8QESxZ220lgPmm0\" rel=\"noopener\">convGRU</a> blocks (a type of convolutional recurrent neural network block) generated 18 grids that represented a 90-minute sequence of predicted precipitation per square kilometer.</li><li>Two discriminators evaluated the generator’s output. A spatial discriminator made up of a convolutional neural network randomly selected eight of the 18 generated maps (for the sake of memory efficiency) and decided whether they were real. A temporal discriminator used 3D convolutions to process the 18 generated maps concatenated with the four input maps. Then it decided whether the generated sequence was real.</li><li>In addition to the comparative loss terms, the discriminators used a loss term that encouraged the generator to minimize the difference, in each grid square, between real radar measurements and the average of six generated maps. This loss term increased the output resolution.</li><li>At inference, the authors ran the generator multiple times and averaged the outputs. They used the variance to estimate uncertainty (for instance, a 20 percent chance of rain).</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors tested their approach at multiple time intervals and distance scales according to the <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2629907?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8F7aKjx7pUXc1DjSdziZd2YeTnRhZmsEV5AQ1WtDmgDnlMsjaP8sR5P8QESxZ220lgPmm0\" rel=\"noopener\">continuous ranked probability score</a>, a modified version of mean average error in which lower is better.

A conditional GAN can turn that capability into a window on the future. Moreover, by averaging multiple attempts by the conditional GAN, it’s possible to compute the certainty of a given outcome.<br><br><strong>We're thinking: </strong>Predicting the weather isn’t just hard, it’s variably hard —  it’s far harder at certain times than at others.
