But I find that users, including both consumers and developers building on such software, don’t always have a sophisticated framework for evaluating how software providers store, use, and share their data. For example, does a company’s promise “not to train on customer data” mean your data is private?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Here is a framework for thinking about different levels of privacy on cloud platforms, from less to more:</em></p><ul><li><em><strong>No Guarantees:&nbsp;</strong>The company provides no guarantees that your data will be kept private. For example, an AI company might train on your data and use the resulting models in ways that leak it. Many startups start here but add privacy guarantees later when customers demand them.</em></li><li><em><strong>No Outside Exposure:</strong>&nbsp;The company does not expose your data to outsiders. A company can meet this standard by not training on your data and also by not posting your data online. Many large startups, including some providers of large language models (LLMs), currently operate at this level.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em><strong>Limited Access:</strong>&nbsp;In addition to safeguards against data leakage, no humans (including employees, contractors, and vendors of the company) will look at your data unless they are compelled via a reasonable process (such as a subpoena or court order, or if the data is flagged by a safety filter). Many large cloud companies effectively offer this level of privacy, whether or not their terms of service explicitly say so.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em><strong>No Access:&nbsp;</strong>The company cannot access your data no matter what. For example, data may be stored on the customer’s premises, so the company doesn’t have access to it. If I run an LLM on my private laptop, no company can access my prompts or LLM output. Alternatively, if data is used by a SaaS system, it might be encrypted before it leaves the customer’s facility, so the provider doesn’t have access to an unencrypted version. For example, when you use an end-to-end encrypted messaging app such as Signal or WhatsApp, the company cannot see the contents of your messages (though it may see “envelope” information such as sender and recipient identities and the time and size of the message).</em></li></ul><p><em>These levels may seem clear, but there are many variations within a given level. For instance, a promise not to train on your data can mean different things to different companies. Some forms of generative AI, particularly image generators, can&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/spotting-similarities-between-generated-images-and-data/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8sMbahNXDHmyN3uHeQvTD_vvo7cOsU3NmGHVQt_hHUFpOdPn5IhFgdOJlOQsHUr5ENYDga\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>replicate their training data</em></a><em>, so training a generative AI algorithm on customer data may run some risk of leaking it. On the other hand, tuning a handful of an algorithm’s hyperparameters (such as learning rate) to customer data, while technically part of the training process, is very unlikely to result in any direct data leakage. So how the data is used in training will affect the risk of leakage. &nbsp;</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/unnamed--97--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/unnamed--97--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/unnamed--97--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/unnamed--97--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Similarly, the Limited Access level has its complexities. If a company offers this level of privacy, it’s good to understand exactly under what circumstances its employees may look at your data. And if they might look at your data, there are shades of gray in terms of how private the data remains. For example, if a limited group of employees in a secure environment can see only short snippets that have been disassociated from your company ID, that’s more secure than if a large number of employees can freely browse your data.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>In outlining levels of privacy, I am not addressing the question of security. To trust a company to deliver a promised level of privacy is also to trust that its IT infrastructure is secure enough to keep that promise.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Over the past decade, cloud hosted SaaS software has gained considerable traction. But some customers insist on running on-prem solutions within their own data centers. One reason is that many SaaS providers offer only No Guarantees or No Outside Exposure, but many customers’ data is so sensitive that it requires Limited Access.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>I think it would be useful for our industry to have a more sophisticated way to talk about privacy and help users understand what guarantees providers do and do not deliver.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>As privacy becomes a global topic, regulators are stepping in, and this is adding further complexity to tech businesses. For example, if one jurisdiction changes the definition of a child from someone under 13 to anyone under 18, that might require changes to how you store data of individuals age 13 to 18; but who has time to keep track of such changes?</em></p><p><em>I've been delighted to see that here, AI can help.

It also transformed into carbon the papyrus scrolls, which originally would have unrolled to lengths as long as 30 feet.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Competitors were given extremely high-resolution, three-dimensional X-ray scans of four intact scrolls. Like CT scans, each scan comprised a series of 2D cross sections. An application developed by researchers who have been working to decipher the scrolls virtually unwrapped the 3D scans into 2D images of the scroll surfaces and segmented them into individual papyrus sheets.</li><li>Examining the resulting images by eye, a member of a different team noticed faint patterns of cracks and lines that suggested Greek letters.

The team manually compared TimeSformer’s images with those produced by the other two models to ensure that TimeSformer didn’t misclassify patches as having ink when it wasn’t there.</li><li>Working on one of the four scrolls (the other three having proven more difficult to scan, unwrap, and segment), the team rendered readable 85 percent of the presumed characters in four 140-character passages — thus satisfying the grand-prize criteria. They also rendered 11 additional passages for a total of more than 2,000 characters, or roughly 5 percent of the scroll.

Reading them all would make this library one of the largest collections of texts recovered from the ancient world.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;The winning team’s achievement testifies to the ability of deep learning to help solve difficult problems. And their work may have broader significance: Recovering the entire Herculaneum library could provide insights into literature, philosophy, history, science, and art at the time of Caesar.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;University of Kentucky computer scientist Brent Seales, who helped design the contest as well as pioneering the use of medical imaging and machine learning to read ancient texts, reckons that over 1,000 teams worked on the problem, amounting to 10 person-years and two compute-years. It's a great example of the power of global collaboration and open resources — central facets of the AI community — to find solutions to hard problems.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/unnamed--98-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/unnamed--98-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/unnamed--98-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/unnamed--98-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"us-restricts-ai-robocalls\">U.S. Restricts AI Robocalls</h1><p>The United States outlawed unsolicited phone calls that use AI-generated voices.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;The Federal Communications Commission&nbsp;<a href=\"https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/fcc-ai-robocalls-ruling.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8sMbahNXDHmyN3uHeQvTD_vvo7cOsU3NmGHVQt_hHUFpOdPn5IhFgdOJlOQsHUr5ENYDga\" rel=\"noopener\">ruled</a>&nbsp;that the current legal restriction on voice communications that use “artificial or prerecorded voices” covers AI-powered voice generation.

It’s unclear how much of that figure is attributable to AI, but the share is likely to grow.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;The world needs innovation in both energy resources and power-efficient machine learning. The dawning era of pervasive AI brings with it the challenge of producing energy to develop and deploy the technology, which can contribute to pollution that disrupts ecosystems and accelerates climate change. Fortunately, AI can shrink the environmental footprint of some energy-intensive activities; for example, searching the web for information generates far less CO<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;emissions than driving to a library.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Climate change is a slow-motion tragedy. We must push toward AI infrastructure that uses less energy (for example, by using more efficient algorithms or hardware) and emits less carbon (for example, by using renewable sources of energy). That said, concentrating computation in a data center creates a point of significant leverage for optimizing energy usage. For example, it’s more economical to raise the energy efficiency of 10,000 servers in a data center than 10,000 PCs that carry out the same workload in 10,000 homes.&nbsp;</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/unnamed---2024-02-14T153023.937.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/unnamed---2024-02-14T153023.937.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"better-images-less-training\">Better Images, Less Training</h1><p>The longer text-to-image models train, the better their output — but the training is costly.

The model learns to use the embedding to remove the noise in successive steps. At inference, it produces an image by starting with pure noise and a text embedding, and removing noise iteratively according to the text embedding.

It can learn much more quickly if, in addition to the text prompt, a separate diffusion model supplies a smaller, noise-free version of the image embedding.&nbsp;During training, the two models can be trained separately, enabling them to learn their tasks in a fraction of the usual time.

They asked 90 people which output they preferred. The judges expressed little preference regarding renderings of MS COCO captions: They chose Würstchen 41.3 percent of the time, Stable Diffusion 40.6 percent of the time, and neither 18.1 percent of the time. However, presented with the results of Parti-prompts, they preferred Würstchen 49.5 percent of the time, Stable Diffusion’s 32.8 percent of the time, and neither 17.7 percent of the time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Training a latent diffusion model to denoise smaller embeddings accelerates training, but this tends to produce lower-quality images. Stacking two diffusion models enabled Würstchen to match or exceed the output quality of models with large embeddings while achieving the training speed of models with small embeddings.</p><p><strong>We're thinking:</strong>&nbsp;25,000 GPU hours is a big reduction from 200,000!
