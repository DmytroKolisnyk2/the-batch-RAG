Did manipulation of social media by generative AI play any role in this election? While many have worried about AI creating fake or misleading content that influences people, generative AI has probably not been the primary method of manipulation in this election cycle. Instead, I think a bigger impact might have been the “amplification effect” where software bots — which don’t have to rely heavily on generative AI — create fake engagement (such as likes/retweets/reshares), leading social media companies’ recommendation algorithms to amplify certain content to real users, some of whom promote it to their own followers. This is how fake engagement leads to real engagement.</p><p>This amplification effect is well known to computer security researchers. It is an interesting sign of our global anxiety about AI that people ascribe social media manipulation to AI becoming more powerful. But the problem here is not that AI is too powerful; rather, it is that AI is not powerful enough. Specifically, the issue is not that generative AI is so powerful that hostile foreign powers or unethical political operatives are successfully using it to create fake media that influences us; the problem is that some social media companies’ AI algorithms are not powerful enough to screen out fake engagement by software bots, and mistake it for real engagement by users. These bots (which don’t need to be very smart) fool the recommender algorithms into amplifying certain content.</p><p><em>The Washington Post&nbsp;</em>reported that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/29/elon-musk-x-republican-democrat-twitter-election/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8jtwfOk6D5T9l3aMoB5j30Oo0yFlxxwXNj-9ziOy86i_Z-feQ5HzcApE72VR8NSj-Gva9K\" rel=\"noreferrer\">tweets on X/Twitter posted by Republicans were more viral than tweets from Democrats</a>. Did this reflect the audience’s deeper engagement with Republican messages than Democratic ones, or have bots influenced this by boosting messages on either side?

The framework uses metrics like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8jtwfOk6D5T9l3aMoB5j30Oo0yFlxxwXNj-9ziOy86i_Z-feQ5HzcApE72VR8NSj-Gva9K\" rel=\"noopener\">MMLU</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10044?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8jtwfOk6D5T9l3aMoB5j30Oo0yFlxxwXNj-9ziOy86i_Z-feQ5HzcApE72VR8NSj-Gva9K\" rel=\"noopener\">BoolQ</a>&nbsp;to assess the impact of small changes in a prompt’s wording. It measures monotonicity (consistency in the relationship between specific inputs and outputs) to see how well a model maintains its internal logic across prompts. It uses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01011?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8jtwfOk6D5T9l3aMoB5j30Oo0yFlxxwXNj-9ziOy86i_Z-feQ5HzcApE72VR8NSj-Gva9K\" rel=\"noopener\">Tensor Trust</a>&nbsp;and LLM RuLES to gauge resistance to cyberattacks. This category also examines whether a model can identify and correct its own errors.</li><li><strong>Privacy and data protection.</strong>&nbsp;Model output must be free of errors, bias, and violations of laws governing privacy and copyright. The framework looks for problematic examples in a model’s training dataset and assesses whether a model repeats erroneous, personally identifying, or copyrighted material that was included in its training set. Many developers don’t provide their models’ training datasets, so the authors use open datasets such as the Pile as a proxy.</li><li><strong>Transparency and interpretability.</strong>&nbsp;Developers must explain the capabilities of their models, and the models themselves must enable those who deploy them to interpret the relationships between inputs and outputs. Measures of interpretability include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03551?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8jtwfOk6D5T9l3aMoB5j30Oo0yFlxxwXNj-9ziOy86i_Z-feQ5HzcApE72VR8NSj-Gva9K\" rel=\"noopener\">TriviaQA</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dbmi.pitt.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Obtaining-well-calibrated-probabilities-using-Bayesian-binning.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8jtwfOk6D5T9l3aMoB5j30Oo0yFlxxwXNj-9ziOy86i_Z-feQ5HzcApE72VR8NSj-Gva9K\" rel=\"noopener\">Expected Calibration Error</a>, which test a model’s ability to gauge its own accuracy. The framework also assesses such requirements by, for instance, testing whether a model will tell users they’re interacting with a machine rather than a person, and whether it watermarks its output.</li><li><strong>Fairness and non-discrimination.</strong>&nbsp;The law requires that model providers document potentially discriminatory outputs of their systems and that high-risk systems reduce the risk of biased outputs.

However, several achieved relatively low scores in fairness and security, suggesting that bias and vulnerability to adversarial attacks are significant issues.</li><li>GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3 Opus achieved the highest aggregate score, 0.89. However, their scores were diminished by low ratings for transparency, since neither model’s training data is disclosed.</li><li>Gemma-2-9B ranked lowest with an aggregate score of 0.72. It also scored lowest on tests of general reasoning (MMLU), common-sense reasoning (HellaSwag), and self-assessment (a model’s certainty in its answers to TriviaQA).</li><li>Some models performed well on typical benchmark tasks but less well in areas that are less well studied or easily measured. For instance, Qwen1.5-72B struggled with interpretability (0.61). Mixtral-8x7B performed poorly in resistance to cyberattacks (0.32).</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong>&nbsp;The authors note that some provisions of the AI Act, including explainability, oversight (deference to human control), and corrigibility (whether an AI system can be altered to change harmful outputs, which bears on a model’s risk classification under the AI Act), are defined ambiguously under the law and can’t be measured reliably at present. These areas are under-explored in the research literature and lack benchmarks to assess them.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;With the advent of laws that regulate AI technology, developers are responsible for assessing a model’s compliance before they release it or use it in ways that affect the public. COMPL-AI takes a first step toward assuring model builders that their work is legally defensible or else alerting them to flaws that could lead to legal risk if they’re not addressed prior to release.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Thoughtful regulation of AI is necessary, but it should be done in ways that don’t impose an undue burden on developers. While the AI Act itself is overly burdensome, we’re glad to see a largely automated path to demonstrating compliance of large language models.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/11/unnamed--26-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"MLE-Bench workflow showing competition steps for model training, testing, and leaderboard scoring.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/unnamed--26-.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/unnamed--26-.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/11/unnamed--26-.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"when-agents-train-algorithms\">When Agents Train Algorithms</h1><p>Coding agents are improving, but can they tackle machine learning tasks?</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;Chan Jun Shern and colleagues at OpenAI introduced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07095?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8jtwfOk6D5T9l3aMoB5j30Oo0yFlxxwXNj-9ziOy86i_Z-feQ5HzcApE72VR8NSj-Gva9K\" rel=\"noopener\">MLE-bench</a>, a benchmark designed to test how well AI coding agents do in competitions hosted by the Kaggle machine learning contest platform.
