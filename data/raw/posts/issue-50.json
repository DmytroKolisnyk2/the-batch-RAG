Yet the company itself warns against overhyping the new model. “It still has serious weaknesses and sometimes makes very silly mistakes,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sama/status/1284922296348454913?s=20&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">tweet</a>.<br><br><strong>Bigger is better:</strong> GPT-3 owes much of its performance to a gargantuan parameter count of 175 billion, which dwarfs GPT-2’s 1.5 billion and exceeds by an order of magnitude <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/a-no-frills-guide-to-most-natural-language-processing-models-the-transformer-xl-era-ff5035f04e0f?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">recent models</a> from Google (11 billion) and Microsoft (17 billion).<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Large language models based on the transformer architecture have made natural language processing one of the most exciting areas of machine learning.

The app, developed by Tokyo-based advertising and technology company <a href=\"https://www.dentsu.com/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Dentsu</a>, mimics an experienced grader’s judgement.</p><ul><li>The model was trained on 4,000 images of tuna tail cross sections annotated by human graders.

We hope the company isn’t giving them a raw deal.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Otam.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Graphs and data related to Ordered Temporal Alignment Module (Otam)\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"less-video-is-more-examples\">Less (Video) is More (Examples)</h3><p>We’d all love to be able to find similar examples of our favorite cat videos. But few of us want to label thousands of similar videos of even the cutest kitties. New research makes headway in video classification when training examples are scarce.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Jingwei Ji and Zhangjie Cao led Stanford researchers in developing <a href=\"http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Cao_Few-Shot_Video_Classification_via_Temporal_Alignment_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Ordered Temporal Alignment Module</a> (Otam), a model that classifies videos even with limited training data.<br><br><strong>Key insight: </strong>ImageNet provides over a million training examples for image classification models, while the Kinetics <a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/open-source/kinetics?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">video dataset</a> offers an order of magnitude fewer. But each video comprises hundreds of individual frames, so video datasets typically contain more images than image datasets. Why not take advantage of all those examples by applying image recognition techniques to videos? That way, each frame, rather than each video as a whole, serves as a training example.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The task is to find the training video most similar to an input video and apply the same label. A convolutional neural network pre-trained on <a href=\"http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/imagenet.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">ImageNet</a> extracts features for each input frame. Then the system compares the features and finds an alignment between the frames of a novel video and those of a training video. The CNN comprises the only trainable parameters.</p><ul><li>For each pair of frames from a novel video and a training video, Otam generates a similarity score. The pairs can be represented in a matrix whose rows are novel video frames and columns are training video frames. For example, (1,1) is the similarity between first frames and (2,1) represents the similarity between the second frame of the input video and the first frame of the training set video.</li><li>Otam constructs a path through the similarity matrix by connecting frame pairs that are most similar. If an input video and training videos are identical, the path follows the diagonal.</li><li>The system aligns similar frames over time even if the videos differ in length. For instance, if two videos depict different people brewing tea, and one person moves more slowly than the other, Otam will match frames essential to the action and ignore the extra frames that represent the slow-moving brewer. The system calculates video-video similarity by summing frame-frame similarities along the path. In this way, the CNN learns to extract features that lead to similar paths for videos of the same class.</li><li>Ordering frame pairs by similarity can’t be optimized directly via backprop. The researchers formulated a continuous relaxation that weights every possible path by its similarity. (A continuous relaxation takes a nondifferentiable, discrete problem and approximates it with a continuous function that has better-behaved gradients, so backprop can optimize it. For instance, softmax is a continuous relaxation for the operation argmax.)</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> On the <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Kinetics</a> dataset (clips of people taking various actions in a few sections each), Otam achieved one-shot accuracy of 73 percent, a big improvement over the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11415?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">previous</a> state of the art, 68.4 percent. Otam similarly improved the state of the art on <a href=\"https://20bn.com/datasets/something-something?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Something V2</a> dataset, which comprises clips of people interacting with everyday objects.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Some prior video classification systems also use pre-trained CNNs, but they include sequential layers that require lots of video data to train, since an entire video serves as a single training example. Otam eliminates much of that data hunger.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Videos typically include a soundtrack. We hope the next iteration of Otam will compare sounds as well as images.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GIF202.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"GIF 2\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>We’re thrilled to announce the launch of Course 3 of our Natural Language Processing Specialization on Coursera! <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/sequence-models-in-nlp?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Enroll now</a></p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Synced.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Map of China pointing specific places in red\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"ai-against-covid-progress-report\">AI Against Covid: Progress Report</h3><p>A new report details the role of AI in China’s effort to fight the coronavirus.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers at <em><a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2020/06/30/is-your-business-ready-for-the-second-wave-lessons-from-the-chinese-ai-industrys-fight-against-covid-19/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Synced</a></em>, a China-based AI publication, describe how nearly 90 machine learning products have contributed to the country’s pandemic response.<br><br><strong>What it says:</strong> The report presents case studies in five areas: thermal imaging, medical imaging, epidemiology, contact tracing, and drug discovery.

New research helps reinforcement learning models similarly focus on the most important details.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Google’s Yujin Tang, Duong Nguyen, and David Ha developed a reinforcement learning approach that teaches an agent to pay attention only to visual information that helps accomplish a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08165?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">task</a>. This strategy makes it easier to perform similar tasks in new environments.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> In the previous <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10122?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">World Models</a> approach, an agent memorized features when it observed the world and used that knowledge to predict outcomes of future experiences. Memorizing the entire world isn’t necessary because many observable details, such as background color, aren’t helpful when solving a task. Agents should perform better if they block out such details.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors’ approach effectively preprocesses an image before the agent considers it in selecting an action.</p><ul><li>Presented with a new image, the model splits it into small patches.
