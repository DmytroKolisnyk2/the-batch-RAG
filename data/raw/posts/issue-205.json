It also applies to the emerging practice of <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-prompting-is-changing-machine-learning-development/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">prompt-based</a> <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ai-at-the-speed-of-prompting/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">AI</a> <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/visual-prompting-builds-vision-models-in-seconds/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">development</a>.</em></p><p><em>When you’re building a traditional software system, it’s common practice to write a product spec, then write code to that spec, and finally spend time debugging the code and ironing out the kinks. But when you’re building a machine learning system, it’s frequently better to build an initial prototype quickly and use it to identify and fix issues. This is true particularly for building applications that humans can do well, such as unstructured data tasks like processing images, audio, or text.</em></p><ul><li><em>Build a simple system quickly to see how well it does.</em></li><li><em>Figure out where it falls short (via <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/lecture/machine-learning-projects/carrying-out-error-analysis-GwViP?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">error analysis</a> or other techniques), and iteratively try to close the gap between what the system does and what a human (such as you, the developer, or a domain expert) would do given the same data. </em></li></ul><p><em>Machine learning software often has to carry out a sequence of steps; such systems are called pipelines or cascades. Say, you want to build a system to route an ecommerce site’s customer emails to the appropriate department (is this apparel, electronics, . . . ), then retrieve relevant product information using semantic search, and finally draft a response for a human representative to edit. Each of these steps could have been done by a human. By examining them individually and seeing where the system falls short of human-level performance, you can decide where to focus your attention.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/unnamed--35--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/unnamed--35--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/unnamed--35--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/unnamed--35--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>While debugging a system, I frequently have a “hmm, that looks strange” moment that suggests what to try next. For example, I’ve experienced each of the following many times:</em></p><ul><li><em>The learning curve doesn’t quite look right.</em></li><li><em>The system performs worse on what you think are the easier examples.</em></li><li><em>The loss function outputs values that are higher or lower than you think it should.</em></li><li><em>Adding a feature that you thought would help performance actually hurt.</em></li><li><em>Performance on the test set is better than seems reasonable.</em></li><li><em>An LLM’s output is inconsistently formatted; for example, including extraneous text.</em></li></ul><p><em>When it comes to noticing things like this, experience working with multiple projects is helpful. Machine learning systems have a lot of moving parts. When you have seen many learning curves, you start to hone your instincts about what’s normal and what’s anomalous; or when you have prompted a large language model (LLM) to output JSON many times, you start to get a sense of the most common error modes. These days, I frequently play with building different small LLM-based applications on weekends just for fun. Seeing how they behave (as well as consulting with friends on their projects) is helping me to hone my own instincts about when such applications go wrong, and what are plausible solutions.</em></p><p><em>Understanding how the algorithms work really helps, too. Thanks to development tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch, you can implement a neural network in just a few lines of code — that’s great! But what if (or when!) you find that your system doesn’t work well? Taking courses that explain the theory that underlies various algorithms is useful. If you understand at a technical level how a learning algorithm works, you’re more likely to spot unexpected behavior, and you’ll have more options for debugging it. </em><br><br><em>The notion that much of machine learning development is akin to debugging arises from this observation: When we start a new machine learning project, <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-to-reduce-risk-and-uncertainty-in-ai-projects/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8bRCu1UlRe_k6NCNJbH5u25AwMSbebM_3oQ5Lv7M9VLTdjqB6QT5B61_RNHvry6_ey-sOG\" rel=\"noopener\">we don’t know what strange and wonderful things we’ll find in the data</a>. With prompt-based development, we also don’t know what strange and wonderful things a generative model will produce. This is why machine learning development is much more iterative than traditional software development: We’re embarking on a journey to discover these things. Building a system quickly and then spending most of your time debugging it is a practical way to get such systems working.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"deeplearningai-exclusive\">DeepLearning.AI Exclusive</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/blog/ai-for-good-instructor/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8bRCu1UlRe_k6NCNJbH5u25AwMSbebM_3oQ5Lv7M9VLTdjqB6QT5B61_RNHvry6_ey-sOG\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/V2-1-1-1536x864.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/V2-1-1-1536x864.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/V2-1-1-1536x864.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/V2-1-1-1536x864.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Robert Monarch, the instructor of our new specialization <em>AI for Good</em>, spoke with us about how AI is being applied to social and environmental challenges and how you can join the growing AI for Good movement. <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/blog/ai-for-good-instructor/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Read the interview</a></p><hr><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/STABLEBIAS-4_1200px.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/STABLEBIAS-4_1200px.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/STABLEBIAS-4_1200px.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/STABLEBIAS-4_1200px.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"stable-biases\">Stable Biases</h1><p>Stable Diffusion may amplify biases in its training data in ways that promote deeply ingrained social stereotypes.</p><p><strong>What's new:</strong> The popular text-to-image generator from Stability.ai tends to underrepresent women in images of prestigious occupations and overrepresent darker-skinned people in images of low-wage workers and criminals, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-generative-ai-bias/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8bRCu1UlRe_k6NCNJbH5u25AwMSbebM_3oQ5Lv7M9VLTdjqB6QT5B61_RNHvry6_ey-sOG\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> Stable Diffusion was pretrained on <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/the-story-of-laion-the-dataset-behind-stable-diffusion/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">five billion text-image pairs</a> scraped from the web. The reporters prompted the model to generate 300 face images each of workers in 14 professions, seven of them stereotypically “high-paying” (such as lawyer, doctor, and engineer) and seven considered “low-paying” (such as janitor, fast-food worker, and teacher). They also generated images for three negative keywords: “inmate,” “drug dealer,” and “terrorist.” They analyzed the skin color and gender of the resulting images.</p><ul><li>The reporters averaged the color of pixels that represent skin in each image.

They considered each employee’s work history to gauge the depth and gender diversity of AI staff at each bank.

This study can serve as a heads-up to some professionals that it’s time to prepare — and a signal to AI builders what sorts of models are likely to have an impact.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> As the authors note, an occupation’s exposure to AI does not necessarily put jobs at risk. History suggests the opposite can happen. A 2022 study <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/employment-has-risen-in-some-automation-heavy-professions/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">found</a> that occupations exposed to automation saw increases in employment between 2008 and 2018. Several other studies <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/robots-dont-want-human-jobs/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">found</a> that countries with high levels of automation also tend to have high overall levels of employment.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/HUMANLOOP--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/HUMANLOOP--1-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"sample-efficient-training-for-robots\">Sample-Efficient Training for Robots</h1><p>Training an agent that controls a robot arm to perform a task — say, opening a door — that involves a sequence of motions (reach, grasp, turn, pull, release) can take from tens of thousands to millions of examples. A new approach pretrained an agent on many tasks for which lots of data was available, so it needed dramatically fewer examples to learn related tasks.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Joey Hejna and Dorsa Sadigh at Stanford used a variation on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03363?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8bRCu1UlRe_k6NCNJbH5u25AwMSbebM_3oQ5Lv7M9VLTdjqB6QT5B61_RNHvry6_ey-sOG\" rel=\"noopener\">train</a> an agent to perform a variety of tasks in simulation. The team didn’t handcraft the reward functions. Instead, neural networks learned them.</p><p><strong>RLHF basics: </strong>A popular approach to tuning large language models, RLHF follows four steps: (1) Pretrain a generative model. (2) Use the model to generate data and have humans assign a score to each output. (3) Given the scored data, train a model — called the reward model — to mimic the way humans assigned scores. Higher scores are tantamount to higher rewards. (4) Use scores produced by the reward model to fine-tune the generative model, via reinforcement learning, to produce high-scoring outputs. In short, a generative model produces an example, a reward model scores it, and the generative model learns based on that score.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Machine-generated data is cheap, while human-annotated data is expensive. So, if you’re building a neural network to estimate rewards for several tasks that involve similar sequences of motions, it makes sense to pretrain it for a set of tasks using a large quantity of machine-generated data, and then fine-tune a separate copy for each task to be performed using small amounts of human-annotated data.</p><ul><li>The <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10897?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8bRCu1UlRe_k6NCNJbH5u25AwMSbebM_3oQ5Lv7M9VLTdjqB6QT5B61_RNHvry6_ey-sOG\" rel=\"noopener\">Meta-World</a> benchmark provides machine-generated data for reinforcement learning (RL): It provides simulated environments for several tasks and trained models that execute the tasks. The models make it possible to record motion sequences along with a model’s estimate of its probability of success for each possible motion. Collecting high- and low-probability sequences provides a large dataset of good and bad motions that translate into high or low rewards.</li><li>Humans can annotate such sequences to create a smaller number of examples of motions and rewards. These examples can be curated to highlight cases that make for more efficient learning.</li></ul><p><strong>How it works: </strong>The authors trained an <a href=\"https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/haarnoja18b.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8bRCu1UlRe_k6NCNJbH5u25AwMSbebM_3oQ5Lv7M9VLTdjqB6QT5B61_RNHvry6_ey-sOG\" rel=\"noopener\">RL agent</a> to perform 10 simulated tasks from Meta-World such as pushing a block, opening a door, and closing a drawer. For each task, they fine-tuned a separate pretrained vanilla neural network to calculate rewards used in training the agent.</p><ul><li>The authors pretrained the reward model using a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8bRCu1UlRe_k6NCNJbH5u25AwMSbebM_3oQ5Lv7M9VLTdjqB6QT5B61_RNHvry6_ey-sOG\" rel=\"noopener\">method</a> designed to find weights that could be readily fine-tuned for a new task using a small number of examples. Given two motion sequences and their probabilities (generated by models included in Meta-World), the network was pretrained to decide which was worse or better for executing the task at hand.</li><li>For six new tasks, the authors generated a small number (between 6 and 20 depending on the task) of motion sequences using their agent. Human annotators labeled them better or worse for executing the task at hand. The authors fine-tuned the reward model on these examples.</li><li>Using a small number of motion sequences for the task at hand, the authors trained the agent to complete the task based on rewards calculated by the reward model.</li><li>The authors repeated the loop — fine-tuning the reward model and training the agent — fine-tuning the reward model on up to 100 total human-annotated motion sequences for a task. They stopped when the agent’s performance no longer improved.</li><li>The authors tried the same experiment substituting human annotations for Meta-World’s model-generated probabilities for the motion sequences. It took up to 2,500 total sequences for the agent to reach its optimal performance.</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>Trained to open a window, the agent achieved 100 percent success after fine-tuning on 64 human-annotated motion sequences. Trained to close a door, it achieved 95 percent success with 100 human-annotated motion sequences. In contrast, using the same number of examples, <a href=\"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/lee21i/lee21i.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8bRCu1UlRe_k6NCNJbH5u25AwMSbebM_3oQ5Lv7M9VLTdjqB6QT5B61_RNHvry6_ey-sOG\" rel=\"noopener\">PEBBLE</a>, another RL method that involves human feedback, achieved 10 percent and 75 percent success respectively. Fed machine-generated examples rather than human feedback, the agent achieved 100 percent success on all Meta-World tasks except pressing a button after fine-tuning on 2,500 examples — 20 times fewer than PEBBLE required to achieve the same performance.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>OpenAI famously <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/a-kinder-gentler-language-model/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">fine-tuned ChatGPT using RLHF</a>, which yielded higher-quality, safer output. Now this powerful technique can be applied to robotics.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Pretraining followed by fine-tuning opens the door to <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/building-ai-systems-no-longer-requires-much-data/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">building AI systems that can learn new tasks from very little data</a>.
