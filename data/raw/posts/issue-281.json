But while the progress of underlying AI technology has indeed sped up over the past 2 years, the fastest acceleration is in applications.</p><p>Consider this: GPT-4 was released March 2023. Since then, models have become much faster, cheaper, sometimes smaller, more multimodal, and better at reasoning, and many more open weight versions are available — so progress has been fantastic! (Claims that AI is “hitting a wall” seem extremely ill-informed.) But more significantly, many applications that&nbsp; already were theoretically possible using the March 2023 version of GPT-4 — in areas such as customer service, question answering, and process automation — now have significant early momentum.</p><p>I’m confident 2025 will see even faster and more exciting advances than 2024 in both AI technology and applications. Looking back, the one thing that could have stopped AI was bad, anti-competitive regulation that would have put onerous burdens on developers, particularly of open models. So long as we remain vigilant and hold off these anti-innovation forces, we’ll keep up or even further accelerate progress.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/12/unnamed--39-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Deer training class with sleigh diagrams on a chalkboard.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/12/unnamed--39-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/12/unnamed--39-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/12/unnamed--39-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>I’m also seeing a widening gap between those at the cutting edge (which includes many readers of&nbsp;<em>The Batch</em>!) and those who have not yet tried out ChatGPT even once (yes, a lot of people are still in this group!).

A leading indicator: From March 2023 to November 2024, OpenAI cut the per-token prices of cloud access to its models by nearly 90 percent even as performance improved, input context windows expanded, and the models became capable of processing images as well as text.</p><p><strong>Driving the story:</strong>&nbsp;Factors that pushed down prices include open source, more compute-efficient models, and excitement around agentic workflows that consume more tokens at inference. OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo set a baseline when it debuted in late 2023 at $10.00/$30.00 per million tokens of input/output. Top model makers slashed prices in turn: Google and OpenAI at the higher end of the market, companies in China at the lower end, and Amazon at both.

Opposition by developers helped to block California SB 1047, a proposed law that would have held developers of models above certain size limits liable for unintended harms caused by their models and required a “kill switch” that would enable developers to disable them — a problematic requirement for open weights models that anyone could modify and deploy. California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed the bill in October.</p><p><strong>Where things stand:</strong>&nbsp;Falling prices are a sign of a healthy tech ecosystem. It’s likely that in-demand models will always fetch relatively high prices, but the market is increasingly priced in pennies, not dollars, per million tokens.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/12/unnamed--43-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Snowman using a camera during snowfall.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/12/unnamed--43-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/12/unnamed--43-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/12/unnamed--43-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"generative-video-takes-off\">Generative Video Takes Off</h1><p>Video generation exploded in an abundance of powerful models.</p><p><strong>What happened:&nbsp;</strong>Companies big and small introduced new or updated text-to-video generators.

Because most models only generate a small number of frames at a time, they can struggle to track physics and geometry and to generate consistent characters and scenery over time. The computational demands of maintaining consistency across frames means that generated clips are brief.

But in 2024, some popular large language models were small enough to run on a smartphone.</p><p><strong>What happened</strong>: Instead of putting all their resources into building big models, top AI companies promoted families of large language models that offer a choice of small, medium, and large. Model families such as Microsoft Phi-3 (in versions of roughly 3.8 billion, 7 billion, and 14 billion parameters), Google Gemma 2 (2 billion, 9 billion, and 27 billion), and Hugging Face SmolLM (135 million, 360 million, and 1.7 billion) specialize in small.</p><p><strong>Driving the story:&nbsp;</strong>Smaller models have become more capable thanks to techniques like knowledge distillation (in which a larger teacher model is used to train a smaller student model to match its output), parameter pruning (which removes less-influential parameters), quantization (which reduces neural network sizes by representing each parameter with fewer bits), and greater attention to curating training sets for data quality. Beyond performance, speed, and price, the ability to run on relatively low-powered hardware is a competitive advantage for a variety of uses.</p><ul><li>Model builders have offered model families that include members of various sizes since at least 2019, when Google introduced the T5 family (five models between roughly 77 million parameters and 11 billion parameters). The success of OpenAI’s GPT series, which over time grew from 117 million parameters to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/11/01/2023/microsoft-pushes-the-boundaries-of-small-ai-models?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8TWMQ2pzYlyupoha6NJn2_c8a9NVXjbrj_SXljxGjznmQTE8OZx9MLwfZlDobYLwnqPJjN\" rel=\"noopener\">hypothesized</a>&nbsp;1.76 trillion parameters, demonstrated the power of bigger models. OpenAI researchers formulated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8TWMQ2pzYlyupoha6NJn2_c8a9NVXjbrj_SXljxGjznmQTE8OZx9MLwfZlDobYLwnqPJjN\" rel=\"noopener\">scaling laws</a>&nbsp;that appeared to guarantee that bigger models, training sets, and compute budgets would lead to predictable improvements in performance. This finding spurred rivals to build larger and larger models.</li><li>The tide started to turn in early 2023. Meta’s Llama 2 came in parameter counts of roughly 7 billion, 13 billion, and 70 billion with open weights.&nbsp;</li><li>In December 2023, Google launched the Gemini family, including Gemini Nano (1.8 billion parameters). In February, it released the small, open weights family Gemma 1 (2 billion and 7 billion parameters), followed by Gemma 2 (9 billion and 27 billion).</li><li>Microsoft introduced Phi-2 (2.7 billion parameters) in December 2023 and Phi-3 (3.8 billion, 7 billion, and 14 billion) in April.&nbsp;</li><li>In August, Nvidia released its Minitron models. It used a combination of distillation and pruning to shrink Llama 3.1 from 8 billion to 4 billion parameters and Mistral NeMo from 12 billion to 8 billion parameters, boosting speed and lowering computing costs while maintaining nearly the same level of accuracy.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong>&nbsp;Distillation, pruning, quantization, and data curation are longstanding practices. But these techniques have not resulted in models quite this ratio of size and capability before, arguably because the larger models that are distilled, pruned, or quantized have never been so capable.</p><ul><li>In 1989, Yann LeCun and colleagues at Bell Labs published “<a href=\"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/1989/file/6c9882bbac1c7093bd25041881277658-Paper.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8TWMQ2pzYlyupoha6NJn2_c8a9NVXjbrj_SXljxGjznmQTE8OZx9MLwfZlDobYLwnqPJjN\" rel=\"noopener\">Optimal Brain Damage</a>,” which showed that&nbsp; deleting weights selectively could reduce a model’s size and, in some cases, improve its ability to generalize.</li><li>Quantization dates to 1990, when E.
