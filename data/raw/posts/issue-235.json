At the time of this writing, the open source Mixtral-8x7b-Instruct is competitive with GPT-3.5-Turbo, which holds 11th place. Meanwhile, I'm hearing about many small, capable teams that, like Mistral, seem to have the technical capability to train foundation models. I think 2024 will see a lot of new teams enter the field with strong offerings.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>The barriers to building foundation large language models (LLMs) seem to be falling as the know-how to train them diffuses. In the past year, a lot of LLM technology has taken steps toward becoming commoditized. If it does become commoditized, who will be the winners and losers?</em></p><p><em>Meta has played a major role in shaping the strategic landscape by emphasizing open source. Unlike its big-tech peers, it makes money by showing ads to users, and does not operate a cloud business that sells LLM API calls. Meta has been badly bitten by its dependence on iOS and Android, which has left it vulnerable to Apple and Google hurting its business by&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/technology/apple-privacy-changes-meta.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Y8VcIGPKkvslnBMAruA5kYkKFHHrjyvME8HtPe9IOfXg7q3zodrZXs1REGGzuHPrOe2MJ\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>imposing</em></a><em>&nbsp;privacy controls that limit its ability to target ads precisely.&nbsp;Consequently, Meta has a strong incentive to support relatively open platforms that it can build upon and aren’t controlled by any one party. This is why releasing Llama as open source makes a lot of sense for its business (as does its strong support for PyTorch as a counterweight to Google’s TensorFlow). The resulting open source offerings are great for the AI community and diffusion of knowledge!&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>In contrast, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure stand to benefit more if they manage to offer dominant, closed source LLMs that are closely tied to their cloud offerings. This would help them to grow their cloud businesses. Both Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, as well as Amazon AWS, are in a good position to build meaningful businesses by offering LLM API calls as part of their broader cloud offerings. However, I expect their cloud businesses to do okay even if they don’t manage to offer an exclusive, clearly dominant LLM (such as Gemini, GPT-4, or their successors). If LLMs become commoditized, they should do fine simply by integrating any new LLMs that gain traction into their API offerings.&nbsp;</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/unnamed--50-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/unnamed--50-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/unnamed--50-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/unnamed--50-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Open or closed, LLMs also offer these companies different opportunities for integration into their existing product lines. For example, Microsoft has a huge sales force for selling its software to businesses. These sales reps are a powerful force for selling its Copilot offerings, which complement the company’s existing office productivity tools. In contrast, Google faces greater risk of disruption to its core business, since some users see asking an LLM questions as a replacement for, rather than a complement to, web search. Nonetheless, it’s making a strong showing with Bard/Gemini. Meta also stands to benefit from LLMs becoming more widely available. Indeed, LLMs are already useful in online advertising, for example, by helping write ad copy to drives more clicks.</em></p><p><em>Tech giants can afford to invest hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in building LLM technology only to see it become commoditized shortly afterward. Startups would have a harder time surviving after burning this much cash with little to show for it. However, well funded startups will have some time to explore other paths to growing revenue and building a moat.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, competition among companies that offer LLMs is great for everyone who builds applications!

The rapid progress of image generators enables unscrupulous (or simply cruel) parties to prey on innocent victims in ways that exact a terrible toll for which reparation may be inadequate or impossible. In many jurisdictions, the laws against nonconsensual pornography don’t account for AI-generated or AI-edited images. To be actionable, for instance, such images must depict the victim’s own body rather than a generated look-alike.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;No one, whether a public or private figure, child or adult, should be subject to the humiliation and abuse of being depicted in nonconsensual pornographic images. The U.S., whose constitution guarantees free speech, has weaker tools for silencing harmful messages than other countries. Nonetheless, we hope that Swift gets the justice she seeks and that lawmakers craft thoughtful legislation to protect citizens and provide recourse for victims without banning legitimate applications.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/unnamed---2024-02-07T153540.653.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/unnamed---2024-02-07T153540.653.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/unnamed---2024-02-07T153540.653.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/unnamed---2024-02-07T153540.653.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"new-leaderboards-rank-safety-more\">New Leaderboards Rank Safety, More</h1><p>Hugging Face introduced four leaderboards to rank the performance and trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs).</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;The open source AI repository now ranks performance on tests of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboards-on-the-hub-patronus?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Y8VcIGPKkvslnBMAruA5kYkKFHHrjyvME8HtPe9IOfXg7q3zodrZXs1REGGzuHPrOe2MJ\" rel=\"noopener\">workplace utility</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboards-on-the-hub-decodingtrust?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Y8VcIGPKkvslnBMAruA5kYkKFHHrjyvME8HtPe9IOfXg7q3zodrZXs1REGGzuHPrOe2MJ\" rel=\"noopener\">trust and safety</a>, tendency to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboards-on-the-hub-hallucinations?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Y8VcIGPKkvslnBMAruA5kYkKFHHrjyvME8HtPe9IOfXg7q3zodrZXs1REGGzuHPrOe2MJ\" rel=\"noopener\">generate falsehoods</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboards-on-the-hub-nphardeval?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Y8VcIGPKkvslnBMAruA5kYkKFHHrjyvME8HtPe9IOfXg7q3zodrZXs1REGGzuHPrOe2MJ\" rel=\"noopener\">reasoning</a>.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The new leaderboards implement benchmarks developed by HuggingFace’s research and corporate partners.

The large language model was barely more helpful than the web.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The researchers asked both trained biologists and biology students to design a biological threat using either web search or web search plus GPT-4.</p><ul><li>The authors recruited 50 experts who had doctorates and experience in a laboratory equipped to handle biohazards, and 50 students who had taken a biology course at an undergraduate level or higher. All participants were U.S. citizens or permanent residents and passed a criminal background check.</li><li>Half of each group were allowed to search the web. The other half also had access to GPT-4. (The experts were given a research version of the model that was capable of answering dangerous questions with limited safeguards.)</li><li>Participants were asked to complete 5 tasks that corresponded to steps in building a biological threat: (i) choose a suitable biohazard, (ii) find a way to obtain it, (iii) plan a process to produce the threat in a sufficient quantity, (iv) determine how to formulate and stabilize it for deployment as a bioweapon, and (v) identify mechanisms to release it.</li><li>The authors scored completion of each task for accuracy, completeness, and innovation (0 to 10) as well as time taken (in minutes). Participants scored each task for difficulty (0 to 10).</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;Participants who used GPT-4 showed slight increases in accuracy and completeness.Students with GPT-4 scored 0.25 and 0.41 more points on average, respectively, than students in the control group. Experts with access to the less restricted version of GPT-4 scored 0.88 and 0.82 points higher on average, respectively, than experts in the control group. However, these increases were not statistically significant. Moreover, participants who used GPT-4 didn’t show greater innovation, take less time per task, or view their tasks as easier. Even if GPT-4 could be prompted to provide information that would facilitate a biological attack, the model didn’t provide more information than a user could glean by searching the web.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;AI alarmists have managed to create a lot of anxiety by promoting disaster scenarios, such as human extinction, that the technology has no clear way to bring about. Meanwhile, the unfounded fears stand to slow down developments that could do tremendous good in the world. Evidence that GPT-4 is no more likely than web search to aid in building a bioweapon is a welcome antidote. (Though we would do well to consider removing from the web unnecessary information that may aid in the making of bioweapons.)</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Large language models, like other multipurpose productivity tools such as web search or spreadsheet software, are potentially useful for malicious actors who want to do harm. Yet AI’s potential in biothreat development garners headlines, while Excel’s is rarely mentioned. That makes it doubly important to quantify the risk in ways that can guide regulators and other decision makers.&nbsp;</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/unnamed---2024-02-07T153903.061.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/unnamed---2024-02-07T153903.061.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/unnamed---2024-02-07T153903.061.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/unnamed---2024-02-07T153903.061.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"llms-can-get-inside-your-head\">LLMs Can Get Inside Your Head</h1><p>Most people understand that others’ mental states can differ from their own.
