In the example above, around five years later, a growing number of people were able to code up deep learning models in C++.

For instance, frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch made building neural networks simpler and more systematic, and implementations were much less likely to fail due to a stray C++ pointer.</em></li></ul><p><em>The data-centric AI movement is going through such a process. Data-centric AI is the growing discipline of systematically engineering the data needed to build successful AI systems. This contrasts with the model-centric approach, which focuses on inventing and tuning machine learning model architectures while holding the data fixed.</em></p><p><em>Experienced machine learning practitioners have been engineering data by hand for decades.

About half received sertraline (Zoloft), and the other half received a placebo. The second included 37 participants in the first trial who had not responded to sertraline.

The authors augmented the scans using a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352095045_The_BLENDS_Method_for_Data_Augmentation_of_4-Dimensional_Brain_Images?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Zb7ULtzZKCu9btZq6_dwXKzbfqOWlWg4oI6KUNWxIKR2bV2cnR9WVLuBYVTdHvN0azln8\" rel=\"noopener\">method</a> that changes them in a realistic manner.

A GNN typically represents nodes and edges as vectors and updates them iteratively based on the states of neighboring nodes and edges. Some GNNs represent an entire graph as a vector and update it according to the representations of nodes and edges.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Previous <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07153?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Zb7ULtzZKCu9btZq6_dwXKzbfqOWlWg4oI6KUNWxIKR2bV2cnR9WVLuBYVTdHvN0azln8\" rel=\"noopener\">work</a> found that adding a few layers to a shallow GNN barely improved performance. That study used graphs that comprised hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges. Since then, graphs have emerged with hundreds of <em>millions</em> of nodes and edges. Deeper GNNs may achieve superior performance on these larger datasets.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors built GNNs up to more than 100 layers deep, including an encoder (a vanilla neural network), a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.0126?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Zb7ULtzZKCu9btZq6_dwXKzbfqOWlWg4oI6KUNWxIKR2bV2cnR9WVLuBYVTdHvN0azln8\" rel=\"noopener\">graph network</a> made up of message-passing blocks (each a trio of vanilla neural networks), and a decoder (another vanilla neural network). Among other experiments, they trained a GNN on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09430?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Zb7ULtzZKCu9btZq6_dwXKzbfqOWlWg4oI6KUNWxIKR2bV2cnR9WVLuBYVTdHvN0azln8\" rel=\"noopener\">4 million graphs of molecules</a>, in which nodes are atoms and edges are bonds between them, to estimate a particular key property called the HOMO-LUMO gap. (This property helps determine a molecule’s behavior in the presence of light, electricity, and other chemicals.)</p><ul><li>Given a graph, the encoder generated an initial representation of each edge, each node, and the entire graph.</li><li>A series of message passing blocks updated the representations iteratively: (1) A three-layer vanilla neural network updated each edge representation based on the previous representation, the two nodes on either side, and the graph. (2) A three-layer vanilla neural network updated each node representation based on the previous representation, all connected edges, and the graph. (3) A three-layer vanilla neural network updated the graph representation based on the previous representation, all edges, and all nodes.</li><li>Given the final representation of the graph, the decoder computed the HOMO-LUMO gap.</li><li>To improve the representations, the authors used <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07971?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Zb7ULtzZKCu9btZq6_dwXKzbfqOWlWg4oI6KUNWxIKR2bV2cnR9WVLuBYVTdHvN0azln8\" rel=\"noopener\">Noisy Nodes</a> self-supervision, which perturbed the representations of nodes or edges and penalized the GNN depending on how well it reconstructed them.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors tested GNNs with different numbers of message-passing blocks. Performance on the validation set improved progressively with more message-passing blocks up to 32 — 104 layers total — but showed no benefit beyond that depth. A version with 8 message-passing blocks achieved ~0.128 mean absolute error, one with 16 achieved ~0.124 mean absolute error, and one with 32 achieved ~0.121 mean absolute error.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Not all types of data can be represented easily as an image or text — consider a social network — but almost all can be represented as a graph. This suggests that deep GNNs could prove useful in solving a wide variety of problems.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> CNNs and RNNs have become more powerful with increasing depth. GNNs may have a lot of room to grow.</p>","comment_id":"61a7e23052157b0048470834","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-01-at-10.36.13-AM-copy.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2021-12-01T12:59:28.000-08:00","updated_at":"2023-06-26T10:08:14.000-07:00","published_at":"2021-12-01T12:00:00.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"I’ve seen many new technologies go through a predictable process on their journey from idea to large scale adoption.
