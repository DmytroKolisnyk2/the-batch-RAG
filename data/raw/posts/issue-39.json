Sometimes the system produced gibberish. For instance, it translated brain waves representing, “the woman is holding a broom” into “the little is giggling giggling.” But much of its output was very close to the spoken words: “The ladder was used to rescue the cat and the man” came out as “which ladder will be used to rescue the cat and the man.”<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Brain activity isn’t spoken or readable in the usual sense, but it has structural similarities to language.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Patients undergoing surgery for epilepsy had electrodes attached to the cortical surface. The researchers captured neural activity while the speaker read a sentence and discarded signals with the lowest strength. A model learned to translate the brain waves into a transcript.</p><ul><li>Brain scans often detect signals at different times relative to when they began. A convolutional filter applied across time captured the signals within a time window to account for mistimings.</li><li>A recurrent neural network learned to extract key features of a sequence of filtered brain activity one time window at a time. After that RNN extracted the features of an entire sequence, a second RNN learned to reconstruct the spoken sentence one word at a time based on the features and the previously predicted word.</li><li>During training, another network predicted features of the sentence’s sound based on the extracted features. This additional task helped the first RNN to extract brainwave features most closely related to the sentence.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers evaluated their method by word error rate (WER) between true and predicted sentences. Trained on one person reading 50 distinct sentences, the network achieved a 3 percent WER. The network vastly outperformed the previous state of the art, which scored 60 percent WER measured on a different dataset.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> The researchers tested their network on a larger vocabulary than previous methods. Still, the vocabulary was small: only around 250 words. Classifying a brain wave as one of 250 words is easier than recognizing it among the 170,000 in the English language.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The ability to find words in brain waves cracks open a sci-fi Pandora’s box. It’s worth emphasizing that the researchers read brain waves associated with speech, not necessarily thought. Yet it’s amazing that the same learning algorithm works for both brain-to-language and language-to-language translations.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> We look forward to upgrading Alexa from voice recognition to mind reading (except for the annoying detail of implanting electrodes in our brains).</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Cartoon.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Excerpts from Newspaper Navigator\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"an-archive-unearthed\">An Archive Unearthed</h3><p>An algorithm indexed photos, ads, and other images embedded in 170 years of American newspapers.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Created by researchers at the University of Washington and U.S. Library of Congress, <a href=\"https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Newspaper Navigator</a> uses object recognition to organize visual features in 16 million pages of newspapers dating back to 1789.

It turns out that teacher networks can do the same.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Hieu Pham led joint work by Carnegie Mellon and Google Brain that trained teacher models (larger, pretrained networks) to educate student models (smaller networks that learn from the teacher’s predictions) more effectively by observing and adjusting to student performance. The method’s name, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10580?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Meta Pseudo Labels</a>, refers to meta-learning: in this case, learning from predictions that have been tweaked to optimize their educational value rather than their accuracy. Pseudo labels are teacher classifications, either binary or values between 0 and 1, that a student learns to re-create.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> A teacher may generate predictions showing that one dog looks more like a wolf than a cat, while another dog falls in between. But its pseudo label “dog” doesn’t capture that difference. For instance, a model considering two images may output [0.8, 0.2, 0.0] and [0.6, 0.2, 0.2] to express its confidence that they depict a dog, wolf, or cat. Both classifications reflect high confidence that the image is a dog, but they contain more nuanced information. Rather than receiving only the highest-confidence classifications, the student will learn better if the teacher adjusts its predictions to exaggerate, say, the dogishness of wolfish dogs. For example, the teacher may change [0.8, 0.2, 0.0] to [0.9, 0.1, 0.0].<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">WideResNet-28-2</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">ResNet 50</a> teachers taught <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">EfficientNet</a> students how to recognize images from <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">CIFAR-10</a> , <a href=\"http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">SVHN</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.image-net.org/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">ImageNet</a>.</p><ul><li>The student learns from a minibatch of images classified by the teacher. Then the student makes predictions on some of the validation set. The teacher learns to minimize the student’s validation loss. The student learns from the teacher’s prediction distribution, so backpropagation can update the teacher based on student errors. Then the process repeats for the next minibatch.</li><li>It may take many training steps before the teacher learns a better distribution. (As any teacher will tell you, the longer students are confused, the less they learn, and the more the teacher must adjust.) The teacher also learns from a small amount of labeled data in the validation set to prevent mis-teaching the student early in training.</li><li>Training the teacher on the validation set may look like a bad idea, but the student is never directly exposed to the validation set’s labels. The teacher’s additional knowledge helps the student generalize without overfitting the validation set.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Meta Pseudo Labels produced a student with higher ImageNet accuracy (86.9 percent) than a supervised model (84.5 percent). The improvements remained when using a limited number of labels from each dataset, where MPL achieved CIFAR-10 accuracy of 83.7 percent compared with a supervised model’s 82.1, and SVHN accuracy to 91.9 percent compared with 88.2. <br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Student-teacher training began as a compression technique.

It involves instructing the neural network to randomly split its computations into two streams each time it runs and recombine the streams at the end of the run. In tests, this approach masked the weights.</li><li>The researchers propose another method called hiding, in which the system artificially turns its power consumption up while running sensitive operations. This makes it impossible for adversaries to measure power consumption.</li><li>The researchers say their masking and hiding methods are adaptable to any type of neural network.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Cryptography researchers wrote about differential power analysis and a related technique called simple power analysis as far back as <a href=\"https://paulkocher.com/doc/DifferentialPowerAnalysis.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">1998</a>.
