While other teams have been prompting LLMs to use computers to build a new generation of RPA (robotic process automation) applications, native support for computer use by a major LLM provider is a great step forward. This will help many developers!</p><p>As agentic workflows mature, here is what I am seeing:</p><ul><li>First, many developers are prompting LLMs to carry out the agentic behaviors they want. This allows for quick, rich exploration!</li><li>In a much smaller number of cases, developers who are working on very valuable applications will fine-tune LLMs to carry out particular agentic functions more reliably. For example, even though many LLMs support function calling natively, they do so by taking as input a description of the functions available and then (hopefully) generating output tokens to request the right function call. For mission-critical applications where generating the right function call is important, fine-tuning a model for your application’s specific function calls significantly increases reliability. (But please avoid premature optimization! Today I still see too many teams fine-tuning when they should probably spend more time on prompting before they resort to this.)</li><li>Finally, when a capability such as tool use or computer use appears valuable to many developers, major LLM providers are building these capabilities directly into their models. Even though OpenAI o1-preview’s advanced reasoning helps consumers, I expect that it will be even more useful for agentic reasoning and planning.</li></ul><p>Most LLMs have been optimized for answering questions primarily to deliver a good consumer experience, and we’ve been able to “graft” them into complex agentic workflows to build valuable applications. The trend of LLMs built to support particular operations in agents natively will create a lot of lift for agentic performance. I’m confident that large agentic performance gains in this direction will be realized in the next few years.</p><p>Keep learning!</p><p>Andrew</p><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/safe-and-reliable-ai-via-guardrails/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/11/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-11-12T092640.086.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Promo banner for &quot;Safe and Reliable AI via Guardrails&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1890\" height=\"1063\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-11-12T092640.086.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-11-12T092640.086.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/11/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-11-12T092640.086.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/11/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-11-12T092640.086.png 1890w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Prevent common issues in applications based on large language models such as hallucinations, data leaks, and off-topic responses.

GPT-4 with search achieved 38.8 percent accuracy.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Agentic workflows are rapidly expanding the scope and capabilities of large language models. As open source software, this system gives developers an extensible toolkit for designing agentic systems. Although it’s oriented toward coding, it accommodates a variety of information-gathering, -processing, and -publishing tasks.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;This system lets users tailor custom agents simply by rewriting prompts.
