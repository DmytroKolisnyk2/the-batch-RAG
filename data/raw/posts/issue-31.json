AI companies could do more if they were allowed access to patient records, but that would require working through thorny privacy issues.

These technologies can’t see the virus itself, however, only the damage it has caused — and by the time such damage is visible, the illness may have progressed too far to be treated easily. Small data techniques might do better, pending further research.</li><li><strong>Treatment:</strong> AI could accelerate discovery of new drugs and vaccines, though that will take time. DeepMind used its <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1923-7?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">AlphaFold</a> model to predict protein structures associated with the virus.

The AI community’s efforts to fight this virus will prove critical when the next one emerges. And there’s plenty we can do outside the medical sphere: Machine learning can help manage critical resources, coordinate responses, and optimize logistics.

SimCLR trains a model to extract features that are unchanged by such transformations, a technique known as contrastive learning.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Unlike other contrastive learning techniques, SimCLR can be used with any model architecture. It requires only multiple data-augmentation methods (which the researchers specify only for images, the subject of this study).</p><ul><li>During training, the researchers modify ImageNet examples, producing pairs that consist of an original and a variant altered by combinations of cropping, flipping, rotation, color distortion, blur, and noise.</li><li>SimCLR trains a model to extract from each version feature vectors with minimal differences in the angles between them.</li><li>The trained model can extract features from a labeled dataset for a downstream classifier that, in turn, learns to map the features to the labels. Alternatively, the model can be fine-tuned using labeled data, in effect using SimCLR as an unsupervised pre-training algorithm.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> A ResNet-50(x4) trained with SimCLR extracted features from ImageNet using all labels. A linear classifier trained on the resulting features achieved 76.5 percent top-1 accuracy, 0.1 percent better than a fully supervised ResNet-50. SimCLR achieved similar results on a variety of other image datasets.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Self-supervised learning schemes often rely on complicated tasks to extract features from unlabeled data. SimCLR simply extracts similar features from similar examples.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> This method seems like it would work well on audio data.

If and when it gets here, machine learning may be ready for it.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02989v1.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">TensorFlow Quantum</a> is a platform for building, training, and deploying neural networks on quantum processors. It was developed by Alphabet, Volkswagen, and the University of Waterloo.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The software works with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">quantum hardware</a> like Google’s Sycamore computer, which has 54 qubits. Each qubit processes multiple calculations at once, theoretically enabling such systems to vastly outperform conventional CPUs.</p><ul><li>TFQ marries TensorFlow with <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/07/announcing-cirq-open-source-framework.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Cirq</a>, a library that makes it easier to map machine learning algorithms to quantum circuitry. Researchers can use Cirq to prototype quantum neural networks built with layers of quantum circuits, and then embed their models within a TensorFlow graph.</li><li>The framework introduces two new concepts: quantum tensors and quantum layers. Quantum tensors are like normal tensors, but they store quantum superpositions (like storing many tensors at once, or storing a batch of tensors). Quantum layers operate on quantum tensors.</li><li>Not all operations are supported, but those that are get a quantum speedup. You can mix quantum tensors and quantum layers with normal tensors and layers, but the conversions between quantum tensors and regular tensors are slow.</li><li>Like the usual TensorFlow, the quantum version works with CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, while adding QPUs to the mix.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Imagine that, instead of living one life, you could live billions of lives simultaneously, and at the end, you would have learned from all of them. Quantum speedups can be enormous for operations in which a single quantum computer can outperform the fastest supercomputer (that is, millions of classical computers working together). Machine learning could be one of those operations.</p><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> It may be a while before quantum computing is practical outside of research labs. Among other challenges, quantum systems are so <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02936-3?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">sensitive </a>that the noise they generate can derail their calculations.</p><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Last year, Google claimed that Sycamore had achieved so-called <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">quantum supremacy</a> by performing a calculation that it deemed impractical for a classical supercomputer. IBM <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/10/on-quantum-supremacy/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">challenged</a> the claim by solving the problem using conventional technology. The two tech giants, which are vying for leadership in the field, remain at loggerheads.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Tech giants are always on the lookout for disruptions that may threaten their business. By creating tools for developers, they’re positioning themselves for a quantum future whether or not it arrives. Meanwhile, machine learning engineers have a shiny new toy to play with!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Radioactive20ASPECT.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Info about radioactive data\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"x-marks-the-dataset\">X Marks the Dataset</h3><p>Which dataset was used to train a given model? A new method makes it possible to see traces of the training corpus in a model’s output.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Alexandre Sablayrolles and colleagues at Facebook and France’s National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation adulterated training data with imperceptible signals. Decisions made by models trained on this so-called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00937?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">radioactive data </a>showed signs of the altered corpus.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Changes in training data can affect the loss in a trained model’s decisions. A small, consistent alteration in the training data affects the loss in a predictable way.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers replaced a portion of images in a training corpus with marked images. After training a model on the whole dataset, they compared the model’s loss on small subsets of marked and unmarked images.</p><ul><li>Consider a two-dimensional classification task, as illustrated above. Displacing the features of examples in one class by a constant amount shifts the decision boundary. This change acts as a fingerprint for the altered dataset.</li><li>Radioactive data extends this intuition to higher dimensions. The algorithm randomly chooses a direction to shift extracted features of each class. Then it learns how to modify input images most efficiently to produce the same shifts.</li><li>There are several ways to identify training on radioactive data, depending on the model. A simple one is to compare the model’s loss for a given class on radioactive and unaltered data. A model trained on radioactive data has a lower loss value on radioactive images because the model recognizes the added structure.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers marked 1 percent of Imagenet and trained a Resnet-18 on the entire dataset. The model’s loss on subsets of radioactive and normal data differed by a statistically significant amount, confirming that the model had been trained on a portion of marked data, while accuracy declined by only 0.1 percent compared to training on standard Imagenet. Different architectures and datasets yielded similar results.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> As neural networks become enmeshed more deeply in a variety of fields, it becomes more helpful to know how they were trained — say, to understand bias or track use of proprietary datasets. This technique, though nascent, offers a potential path to that goal.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Beyond identifying training sets, radioactive data may offer a method to enforce data privacy by making it possible to identify models trained from improperly obtained private data.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Cuneiform.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Clay tablet\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"the-king%E2%80%99s-moleskine\">The King’s Moleskine</h3><p>Machine learning promises to streamline handling of tomorrow’s bureaucratic drudgery — and, it turns out, that of 2,500 years ago.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Computer vision is helping researchers at the University of Chicago <a href=\"https://news.uchicago.edu/story/how-ai-could-help-translate-written-language-ancient-civilizations?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">translate</a> a massive collection of ancient records inscribed on clay tablets.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Persian scribes around 500 BCE produced thousands of documents now collected in the <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/172643/How_many_Persepolis_Fortification_tablets_are_there_?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Persepolis Fortification Archive</a>.
