I’m encouraged by the progress the open source community has made fending off regulations that would have stifled innovation. But opponents of open source are continuing to shift their arguments, with the latest worries centering on open source's impact on national security. I hope we’ll all keep protecting open source!&nbsp;</p><p>Based on my conversations with legislators, I’m encouraged by the progress the U.S. federal government has made getting a realistic grasp of AI’s risks. To be clear, guardrails are needed. But they should be applied to AI applications, not to general-purpose AI technology.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, as I&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/keep-open-source-free/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8LNS8DF2FAurlzNv-TFTZKbJ0jKgiLC0wmKt8MgCKBZQFvWmuJJuwXqSWNb-qAt3KNkO8m\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>&nbsp;previously, some companies are eager to limit open source, possibly to protect the value of massive investments they’ve made in proprietary models and to deter competitors. It has been fascinating to watch their arguments change over time.</p><p>For instance, about 12 months ago, the Center For AI Safety’s “<a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/work/statement-on-ai-risk?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8LNS8DF2FAurlzNv-TFTZKbJ0jKgiLC0wmKt8MgCKBZQFvWmuJJuwXqSWNb-qAt3KNkO8m\" rel=\"noopener\">Statement on AI Risk</a>” warned that AI could cause human extinction and stoked fears of AI taking over. This alarmed leaders in Washington. But many people in AI pointed out that this dystopian science-fiction scenario has little basis in reality. About six months later, when I&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ai-doomsday-scenarios-and-how-to-guard-against-them/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8LNS8DF2FAurlzNv-TFTZKbJ0jKgiLC0wmKt8MgCKBZQFvWmuJJuwXqSWNb-qAt3KNkO8m\" rel=\"noopener\">testified</a>&nbsp;at the U.S. Senate’s AI Insight forum, legislators no longer worried much about an AI takeover.</p><p>Then the opponents of open source shifted gears. Their leading argument shifted to the risk of AI helping to create bioweapons. Soon afterward,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/building-an-early-warning-system-for-llm-aided-biological-threat-creation?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8LNS8DF2FAurlzNv-TFTZKbJ0jKgiLC0wmKt8MgCKBZQFvWmuJJuwXqSWNb-qAt3KNkO8m\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenAI</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rand.org/news/press/2024/01/25.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8LNS8DF2FAurlzNv-TFTZKbJ0jKgiLC0wmKt8MgCKBZQFvWmuJJuwXqSWNb-qAt3KNkO8m\" rel=\"noopener\">RAND</a>&nbsp;showed that current AI does not significantly increase the ability of malefactors to build bioweapons. This fear of AI-enabled bioweapons has diminished. To be sure, the possibility that bad actors could use bioweapons — with or without AI — remains a topic of great international concern.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/05/unnamed---2024-05-08T152327.782-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"674\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/unnamed---2024-05-08T152327.782-1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/unnamed---2024-05-08T152327.782-1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/05/unnamed---2024-05-08T152327.782-1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>The latest argument for blocking open source AI has shifted to national security. AI is useful for both economic competition and warfare, and open source opponents say the U.S. should make sure its adversaries don’t have access to the latest foundation models. While I don’t want authoritarian governments to use AI, particularly to wage unjust wars, the LLM cat is out of the bag, and authoritarian countries will fill the vacuum if democratic nations limit access. When, some day, a child somewhere asks an AI system questions about democracy, the role of a free press, or the function of an independent judiciary in preserving the rule of law, I would like the AI to reflect democratic values rather than favor authoritarian leaders’ goals over, say, human rights.&nbsp;</p><p>I came away from Washington optimistic about the progress we’ve made. A &nbsp;year ago, legislators seemed to me to spend 80% of their time talking about guardrails for AI and 20% about investing in innovation. I was delighted that the ratio has flipped, and there was far more talk of investing in innovation.</p><p>Looking beyond the U.S. federal government, there are many jurisdictions globally. Unfortunately, arguments in favor of &nbsp;regulations that would stifle AI development continue to proliferate. But I’ve learned from my trips to Washington and other nations’ capitals that talking to regulators does have an impact. If you get a chance to talk to a regulator at any level, I hope you’ll do what you can to help governments better understand AI.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep learning,<br>Andrew</p><p>P.S. Two new short courses!</p><ul><li>I’m thrilled to announce our first short course focused on agentic workflows: “<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-agentic-rag-with-llamaindex/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rsco1t53WrNq8oTk-wX4HAtWVypFA6VFpC58cihdUR6gTq4FHeMdGGzcO3FCdxtzMHScF\" rel=\"noopener\">Building Agentic RAG with LlamaIndex</a>,” taught by LlamaIndex CEO Jerry Liu. This covers an important shift in RAG. Rather than having a developer write explicit routines to retrieve information to feed into an LLM’s context, we can build a RAG agent that has access to tools to retrieve information. This lets it decide what information to fetch, and lets it answer more complex questions using multi-step reasoning.</li><li>Additionally, I’m delighted to launch “<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/quantization-in-depth/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rsco1t53WrNq8oTk-wX4HAtWVypFA6VFpC58cihdUR6gTq4FHeMdGGzcO3FCdxtzMHScF\" rel=\"noopener\">Quantization in Depth</a>,” taught by Hugging Face’s&nbsp;Marc Sun and Younes Belkada. Quantization is a key technique for making large models accessible. You’ll learn about implementing linear quantization variants, quantizing at different granularities, and compressing deep learning models to 8-bit and 2-bit precision.</li></ul><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/05/unnamed---2024-05-08T152519.838-1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/unnamed---2024-05-08T152519.838-1.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/unnamed---2024-05-08T152519.838-1.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/05/unnamed---2024-05-08T152519.838-1.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"coding-assistance-start-to-finish\">Coding Assistance Start to Finish</h1><p>GitHub Copilot’s latest features are designed to help manage software development from plan to pull request.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;GitHub&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.blog/2024-04-29-github-copilot-workspace/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8LNS8DF2FAurlzNv-TFTZKbJ0jKgiLC0wmKt8MgCKBZQFvWmuJJuwXqSWNb-qAt3KNkO8m\" rel=\"noopener\">unveiled</a>&nbsp;a preview of Copilot Workspace, a generative development environment that’s designed to encompass entire projects.

Afterward, Copilot Workspace will be available to subscribers to GitHub Copilot (which starts at $10 per month for individuals and $19 per month for businesses).</p><p><strong>How it works:&nbsp;</strong>Copilot Workspace is based on GPT-4 Turbo and integrated with GitHub code repositories and libraries. Where GitHub Copilot previously generated code snippets and provided suggestions for editing code segments, Copilot Workspace integrates these tasks within a larger plan.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Users begin by providing a known bug, feature request, or codebase and then prompting the system. For instance, a user can provide code for a simple Pong-style video game and request a feature, such as an automated opponent to play against.</li><li>Given the request, the system determines the current state of the codebase, then proposes goals the code will meet once the new feature has been implemented. For example, the system might propose, “the computer controls the left paddle automatically, allowing for a single-player game against the computer” and “the game mechanics and logic for the computer’s movement have been added to index.jsx.”</li><li>The goals function as a new prompt, spurring the system to plan intermediate steps to reach them. For instance, the revised plan might include, “add computer player logic for paddle 1 that blocks the ball 95% of the time” and “remove logic for player control of paddle 1.”&nbsp;</li><li>Users can edit all of this before telling the system to carry out the plan. Afterward, the resulting code can be edited, previewed, shared, and subjected to new tests.&nbsp;</li><li>Once the code has passed the tests, users can upload it directly to GitHub as a pull request or fork in the code repository or library.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:&nbsp;</strong>Initial users&nbsp;<a href=\"https://every.to/chain-of-thought/i-spent-24-hours-with-github-copilot-workspaces?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8LNS8DF2FAurlzNv-TFTZKbJ0jKgiLC0wmKt8MgCKBZQFvWmuJJuwXqSWNb-qAt3KNkO8m\" rel=\"noopener\">noted</a>&nbsp;that Copilot Workspace is best at solving straightforward, well defined problems and struggles with more complex ones.

The agreement lets OpenAI train its models on the publisher’s articles and deliver information gleaned from them. This is OpenAI’s fifth such agreement with major news publishers in the past year.</p><p><strong>How it works:&nbsp;</strong>Although the parties didn’t disclose the length of their agreement, OpenAI’s other news licensing deals will end within a few years. The limited commitment suggests that these arrangements are experimental rather than strategic.

Licensing is a way to get such material that is unambiguously legal. Although AI researchers commonly scrape data from the web and use it for training models without obtaining licenses for copyrighted works, whether a license is required to train AI models on works under copyright in the U.S. has yet to be determined. Copyright owners lately have challenged this practice in court. In December 2023,&nbsp;<em>The New York Times</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/the-new-york-times-versus-openai-and-microsoft/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8LNS8DF2FAurlzNv-TFTZKbJ0jKgiLC0wmKt8MgCKBZQFvWmuJJuwXqSWNb-qAt3KNkO8m\" rel=\"noopener\">sued</a>&nbsp;OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming that OpenAI infringed its copyrights by training models on its articles.

Licensing material from publishers gives OpenAI access to their works while offering them incentives to negotiate rather than sue.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;AI developers need huge amounts of media to train larger and larger models. News publishers have huge archives with high-quality text, relatively well written and fact-checked, that’s relevant to current events of interest to a broad audience.

Nongovernmental organizations that remove landmines, including the Norwegian People's Aid and the HALO Trust, are using the system in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;SpotlightAI processes visual-light imagery taken by flying drones. The system provides centimeter-resolution maps that guide mine-removal teams through the territory.</p><ul><li>The system includes an unidentified vision model trained to recognize 150 types of explosive munitions, primarily of U.S. and Russian origin. In a test, the model detected 87 percent of munitions scattered across a munitions test range in Hungary.</li><li>With sufficient computational resources, the system can analyze an image in around 0.5 seconds. A human reviewer typically takes three minutes.</li><li>The system struggles to identify explosives concealed by earth or dense vegetation. To address this limitation, Safe Pro Group has begun to test it with infrared, lidar, magnetometry, and other types of imagery. In addition, the company has developed a system that converts drone imagery into a heat map that shows a machine learning model’s estimated probability that it can detect explosives in a given location. A patch of grass, for example, may have a higher estimated probability than a dense thicket of trees and bushes.</li><li>The company aims to fine-tune its model to detect unexploded ordnance in other current or former conflict zones such as Angola, Iraq, and Laos.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong>&nbsp;In addition to drones, satellites can help machine learning models to find deadly remnants of warfare.
