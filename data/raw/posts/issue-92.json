The task is a exercise for surgeons learning to perform laparoscopic procedures, in which a camera and other specialized instruments are inserted into the patient’s body through a small incision.</p><ul><li>The authors trained an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06163?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--nrounyjmfm5cviAbxglJfJxA6VHX9eV2BMna4Hu4tyKH2SL_LWaeat2KCOg0SsGVhpEWu\" rel=\"noopener\">ensemble</a> of four convolutional neural networks on 180 RGBD (red, green, blue, plus depth) video clips of human surgeons using the robot to demonstrate an error and how to correct it, as well as information about the robot’s joint positions. The system learned to perform the task, but its precision degraded over time as the cables that control the robot’s limbs stretched, causing the model to miss its targets.</li><li>To compensate for the gradual loss of precision, the authors trained an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08520.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--nrounyjmfm5cviAbxglJfJxA6VHX9eV2BMna4Hu4tyKH2SL_LWaeat2KCOg0SsGVhpEWu\" rel=\"noopener\">LSTM</a> on motion-capture data of the robot’s joint positions as the machine performed random motions autonomously.</li><li>Together, the two models proved more agile, precise, and rapid on the ring-and-peg test than human surgeons.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> AI already assists physicians in a few small but important procedures.

(The objects behind the pixels have a basic color that may be modified by lights, shadows, occlusion, and transparency.) NeRF computes a pixel’s color by combining the color/transparency of all points that lie along the associated ray, which requires hundreds of neural network inferences — tough to pull off in real time. FastNeRF manages the computational burden through a two-part workaround. First, rather than calculating on the fly, it pre-computes and stores information about all possible rays and points along them. Second, to avoid having to store every possible combination of ray and point (1,0243 * 1,0242 values, assuming 1,024 samples per spatial dimension), it stores each point’s basic color and transparency based on its position, and the shift in its color due to a ray’s direction (1,0243 + 1,0242 values).</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>  FastNeRF uses two vanilla neural networks to compute information based on a point’s position (the position network) and a ray’s direction (direction network). The authors trained the system on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--nrounyjmfm5cviAbxglJfJxA6VHX9eV2BMna4Hu4tyKH2SL_LWaeat2KCOg0SsGVhpEWu\">Synthetic NeRF</a>, which contains 360-degree views of real-world objects like model ships and LEGO constructions, and frontal views of objects in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00889?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--nrounyjmfm5cviAbxglJfJxA6VHX9eV2BMna4Hu4tyKH2SL_LWaeat2KCOg0SsGVhpEWu\">Local Light Field Fusion</a>.</p><ul><li>FastNeRF evenly samples points throughout the scene. The position network calculates each point’s transparency as well as a vector that represents its basic color. It stores the results.</li><li>Similarly, FastNeRF evenly samples rays pointing in all directions. The direction network calculates a vector that represents how each ray’s direction would affect the color of all points along that ray. It stores that result as well.</li><li>To compute a pixel’s value, FastNeRF combines the transparency, basic color, and the effect of the ray’s direction for every point along the ray.</li><li>It weights each point’s color (from the location network) by the output of the direction network. Then it weights each point’s color by its transparency. Finally, it sums the twice-weighted color of all points along the ray.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Running on a high-end consumer graphs board, FastNeRF performed over 3,000 times faster than NeRF. For example, it rendered a scene of a LEGO tractor in 0.0056 seconds versus NeRF’s 17.46 seconds. Despite its speed, on Synthetic NeRF, FastNeRF achieved 29.97dB peak signal-to-noise ratio, which gauges how well a generated image reproduces the original (higher is better), versus NeRF’s 29.54dB.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The authors reduced an unmanageable quantity of high-dimensional data to a practical size by dividing the information based on point position and ray direction between two models. A similar approach could be useful in applications that require optimization over many input parameters, such as drug discovery and weather modeling.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Augmented and virtual reality promise to bring powerful new approaches in education, entertainment, and industry — if we can make them cheap, easy, and fast enough.
