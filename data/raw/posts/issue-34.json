You can watch the video <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/events/covid-19-and-ai-virtual-conference/video-archive?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">here</a>.<br><br><strong>The agenda:</strong> Nearly two dozen <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/events/covid-19-and-ai-virtual-conference/agenda?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">experts</a> in fields as diverse as machine learning and public health delivered updates on topics from containing the pandemic to finding treatments. A few notable presentations from the six-hour conference:</p><ul><li><strong>Epidemiology:</strong> Given the many people who fall ill but don’t enter a hospital, not to mention those who never show symptoms, it can be maddeningly difficult to track how the disease spreads and how many it kills. Lucy Li of the <a href=\"https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/people/lucy-li/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Chan Zuckerberg BioHub</a> used a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/z4105Exe23Q?t=11480&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">branching model</a> to estimate how many people have been infected. Each time a virus infects a host, it mutates slightly. Analyzing viral DNA extracted from each known patient, the model uses the rate of mutation to interpolate how many other people the virus passed through along the way. According to Li’s estimates, 87 percent of all Chinese cases and 95 percent of total cases have gone undetected.</li><li><strong>Social Distancing:</strong> Stanford pediatrician <a href=\"https://profiles.stanford.edu/chih-hung-wang?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">C. Jason Wang</a> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/z4105Exe23Q?t=10946&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">described</a> how Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center tracked individual Covid-19 cases and enforced social distancing rules. <a href=\"http://taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2020/01/21/2003729605?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Activated</a> in response to the epidemic, the data analytics hub uses GPS, health insurance records, and immigration data to track infections and alert individuals who may have been exposed.</li><li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Creating new drugs from scratch takes a lot of time. So <a href=\"https://bioengineering.stanford.edu/people/stefano-rensi?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Stefano Rensi</a> and colleagues in Stanford’s Department of Bioengineering <a href=\"https://youtu.be/z4105Exe23Q?t=20162&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">searched for existing compounds</a> to fight Covid-19. They used natural language processing to sift the medical literature for clues about how the novel coronavirus delivers its payload to a cell’s nucleus. Then they used a model that predicts protein structure to look for proteins that might inhibit this process. They found 15 known drug candidates that contain this protein, and they’re conducting their own trials to gauge their effectiveness.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Infectious disease expert Dr. Michele Barry <a href=\"https://youtu.be/z4105Exe23Q?t=3591&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">explained</a> that machine learning was critical to keeping infection rates low in Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. All three countries deployed the technology to encourage social distancing, move medical supplies where they were needed most, and keep the public informed.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Machine learning engineers and disease specialists have a lot to learn from one another. Conferences like this can bring them together and build lasting alliances that may result in tools for fighting future outbreaks.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> If you’re itching to join the fight against Covid-19, you can find a list of tools, datasets, and information just above the news in this issue of <em>The Batch</em>.

Researchers are exploring ways to do it automatically.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Esteban Real, Chen Liang, and their colleagues at Google Brain developed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03384v1.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">AutoML-Zero</a>, an evolutionary meta-algorithm that generates a wide variety of machine learning algorithms to classify data. Applied to the small CIFAR-10 image dataset, it discovered several common deep learning techniques.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Past meta-algorithms for machine learning constrain their output to particular architectures. Neural architecture search, for instance, finds only neural networks. AutoML-Zero finds any algorithm that can learn using high school-level math.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers used AutoML-Zero to generate models for various resolutions of CIFAR-10.</p><ul><li>In the authors’ view, a machine learning model comprises a trio of algorithms: Setup initializes parameter values, Predict provides a scalar output given input vectors, and Learn updates weights based on the inputs, training labels, outputs, and current values.</li><li>AutoML-Zero starts with a set of models with empty Setup, Predict, and Learn. It generates a population of models and evolves them for improved performance on a set of tasks.</li><li>The meta-algorithm trains an instance of every model in each training iteration. It applies each model’s Predict and Learn to a task’s training set and evaluates performance on the task’s validation set.</li><li>It culls a random subset of the population and mutates the best-performing model by adding an operation exchanging one operation for another, or switching input variables. The mutated model replaces the oldest model in the subset.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> AutoML-Zero regularly generated models that achieved 84 percent accuracy on CIFAR-10, compared to only 82 percent achieved by a two-layer, fully connected network. In the process, it rediscovered gradient descent, ReLu activations, gradient normalization, and hyperparameters.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The researchers estimate that, given AutoML-Zero’s wide-ranging purview, the chance of coming up with a model suitable for a CIFAR-10 classification task is vanishingly small (around 1 in 107 for linear regression, and 1012 if that line is offset by a constant). Yet it did so frequently — a demonstration of the meta-algorithm’s power to come up with useful architectures. If AutoML-Zero can find nearly state-of-the-art models on such a complex task, it may well be able to discover techniques that humans haven’t yet devised.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> CIFAR-10 was developed over a decade ago for machine learning experiments on the CPU-based neural networks of the day. We’re curious to learn how AutoML-Zero scales to larger datasets.</p><p><strong>We’re not thinking:</strong> Today we have learning algorithms that design other learning algorithms. When will we have learning algorithms that design learning algorithms that design learning algorithms?</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Talent.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Video of Ai-gen-cy, an artist management firm that represents robots\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"robots-to-hollywood-call-my-agent\">Robots to Hollywood: Call My Agent</h3><p>Seeking a robot star for your movie, music video, or bat mitzvah?

The company’s self-driving systems, in turn, learn from the augmented data, effectively giving the researchers a larger training dataset without collecting and labelling additional point clouds.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Waymo’s engineers started with two-dimensional data augmentation methods used to train object recognition models: flipping, rotating, color-shifting, and partially obscuring still images. Since lidar output generates three-dimensional points, Waymo developed ways to perform similar transformations while maintaining the geometrical relationships between points.</p><ul><li>The researchers collected pre-labeled 3D representations of pedestrians, cyclists, cars, and road signs from the <a href=\"https://waymo.com/open/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Waymo Open Dataset</a>.</li><li>They developed eight modes of point-cloud distortion.

But new research shows that it has other effects that may be more important.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Jonathan Frankle and colleagues at MIT, CUNY, and Facebook AI <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00152.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">showed</a> that batch normalization’s trainable parameters alone can account for much of a network’s accuracy.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> As it adjusts a network’s intermediate feature representations for a given minibatch, batch normalization itself learns how to do so in a consistent way for all minibatches. The researchers probed the impact of this learning by training only the batch normalization parameters, gamma (????) and beta (β), while setting all other parameters to random values.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers trained variously sized ResNet and Wide ResNet models, which include batch normalization layers, on the CIFAR-10 image dataset.</p><ul><li>Batch normalization normalizes the output of intermediate layers according to their average and variance across a minibatch. Then it scales them by ???? and shifts them by β. The values of those variables are learned.</li><li>After training batch normalization parameters only, the researchers found that nearly half of ???? values were close to zero. Pruning those values had a negligible impact on performance.</li><li>Deep ResNets had much higher accuracy than wide ResNets with similar numbers of trainable Batch normalization parameters. Batch normalization is known to have greater impact on deeper networks, and apparently scaling and shifting do as well.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Training all the parameters in a ResNet-866 yielded 93 percent accuracy, while training only ???? and β brought 83 percent accuracy. This finding is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.13299?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">further</a> evidence that networks can be accurate even with a large number of random weights.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Batch normalization is often standard procedure in deep learning, but previous studies failed to recognize the power of its trainable parameters. And batchnorm isn’t the only normalization method that scales and shifts parameter values; so do <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07868?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">weight normalization</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10779?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">switchable normalization</a>.
