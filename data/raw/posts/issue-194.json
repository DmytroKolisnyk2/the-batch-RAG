It’s a lot of fun! <a href=\"https://app.landing.ai/public/visual_prompting?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Sx1nvaahZe38-PWjKtUaD7qc__1GepLnIdt39_cou747ve6R6_mI2mgUTn45sU0V089Fp\" rel=\"noopener\">I invite you to try it</a>.</em></p><p><em>Visual Prompting takes ideas from text prompting — which has revolutionized natural language processing — and applies them to computer vision.</em></p><p><em>To build a text sentiment classifier, in the traditional machine learning workflow, you have to collect and label a training set, train a model, and deploy it before you start getting predictions. This process can take days or weeks.</em></p><p><em>In contrast, in the prompt-based machine learning workflow, you can write a text prompt and, by calling a large language model API, start making predictions in seconds or minutes.</em></p><ul><li><em>Traditional workflow: Collect and label -&gt; Train -&gt; Predict</em></li><li><em>Prompt-based workflow: Prompt -&gt; Predict</em></li></ul><p><em>To explain how these ideas apply to computer vision, consider the task of recognizing cell colonies (which look like white blobs) in a petri dish, as shown in the image below. In the traditional machine learning workflow, using object detection, you would have to label all the cell colonies, train a model, and deploy it. This works, but it’s slow and tedious.</em></p><p><em>In contrast, with Visual Prompting, you can create a “visual prompt” in seconds by pointing out (by painting over) one or two cell colonies in the image and similarly pointing out the background region, and get a working model. It takes only a few seconds to (i) create the visual prompt and (ii) get a result. If you’re not satisfied with the initial model, you can edit the prompt (perhaps by labeling a few more cell colonies), check the results, and keep iterating until you’re satisfied with the model’s performance.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-25-at-5.50.35-PM-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-25-at-5.50.35-PM-1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-25-at-5.50.35-PM-1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-25-at-5.50.35-PM-1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>The resulting interaction feels like you’re having a conversation with the system.

That and subsequent API closures are part of a gathering backlash against the AI community’s longstanding practice of training models on data scraped from the web.

Last week a collective of major news publishers <a href=\"https://www.newsmediaalliance.org/ai-principles/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Sx1nvaahZe38-PWjKtUaD7qc__1GepLnIdt39_cou747ve6R6_mI2mgUTn45sU0V089Fp\" rel=\"noopener\">stated</a> that training AI on text licensed from them violates their intellectual property rights.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Although data has always come at a cost, the price of some corpora is on the rise. Discussion sites like Reddit are important repositories of conversation, and text from Stack Overflow has been instrumental in helping to train language models to write computer code. The legal status of existing datasets and models is undetermined, and future access to data depends on legal and commercial agreements that have yet to be negotiated. <br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>It’s understandable that companies watching the generative AI explosion want a slice of the pie and worry that users might leave them for a chatbot trained on data scraped from their own sites. Still, we suspect that charging for data will put smaller groups with fewer resources at a disadvantage, further concentrating power among a handful of wealthy companies.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/04/unnamed--54-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/04/unnamed--54-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"conversational-search-google-style\">Conversational Search, Google Style</h1><p>Google’s response to Microsoft’s GPT-4-enhanced Bing became a little clearer.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Anonymous insiders leaked details of Project Magi, the search giant’s near-term effort to enhance its search engine with automated conversation, <em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/technology/google-search-engine-ai.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Sx1nvaahZe38-PWjKtUaD7qc__1GepLnIdt39_cou747ve6R6_mI2mgUTn45sU0V089Fp\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>.

These include an image generation tool called GIFI for Google Images and a chatbot called Tivoli Tutor for learning languages.<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Google has been scrambling to integrate AI features. The company recently combined Brain and DeepMind into a single unit to accelerate AI research and development. In March, rumors emerged that Samsung, which pays Google substantial licensing revenue to use its search engine in mobile devices, was considering a switch to Bing. The previous month, Bard made factual errors during a public demo, which contributed to an 8 percent drop in Google’s share price. These moves followed a December 2022 “code red” response to Microsoft’s plans to upgrade Bing with conversational technology from OpenAI.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> When it comes to finding information, conversational AI is a powerful addition to, and possibly a replacement for, web search. Google, as the market leader, can’t wait to find out. The ideas Google and its competitors implement in coming months will set the mold for conversational user interfaces in search and beyond.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Should chatbots be integrated with search or designed as separate products? Microsoft and Google are taking different approaches. Microsoft’s conversational model is deeply integrated with Bing search, while Google's Bard currently stands alone. Given the differences between chat and search, there’s a case to be made for keeping chatbots distinct from search engines.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <strong><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></strong></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/ai-for-good?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/04/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--9-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--9-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--9-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/04/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--9-.jpg 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/04/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--9-.jpg 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Are you ready to turn your passion into practice?

In 2021, Lost Tapes of the 27 Club used an unspecified AI method to produce music in the style of artists who died young including Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, and Amy Winehouse. The previous year, OpenAI demonstrated Jukebox, a system that generated recordings in the style of many popular artists.</p><p><strong>Yes, but: </strong>The record industry is moving to defend its business against such audio fakery (or tributes, depending on how you want to view them). Universal Music Group, which controls about a third of the global music market, recently <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/universal-music-group-targets-ai-generated-music/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">pushed</a> streaming services to block AI developers from scraping musical data or posting songs in the styles of established artists.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Every new generation of technology brings new tools to challenge the record industry’s control over music distribution. The 1970s brought audio cassettes and the ability to cheaply copy music, the 1980s brought sampling, the 1990s and 2000s brought remixes and mashups. Today AI is posing new challenges. Not everyone in the music industry is against these AI copycats: The electronic artist Grimes said she would share royalties with anyone who emulates her voice, and Oasis’ former lead singer apparently enjoyed the AI-powered imitation.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Musicians who embrace AI will open new creative pathways, but we have faith that traditional musicianship will endure.

Recent work found that replication does occur.</p><p><strong>What's new</strong>: Gowthami Somepalli and colleagues at University of Maryland devised a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03860?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Sx1nvaahZe38-PWjKtUaD7qc__1GepLnIdt39_cou747ve6R6_mI2mgUTn45sU0V089Fp\" rel=\"noopener\">method</a> that spots instances of image generators copying from their training sets, from entire images to isolated objects, with minor variations.</p><p><strong>Key insight: </strong>A common way to detect similarity between images is to produce embeddings of them and compute the dot product between embeddings. High dot product values indicate similar images. However, while this method detects large-scale similarities, it can fail to detect local ones. To detect a small area shared by two images, one strategy is to split apart their embeddings, compute the dot product between the pieces, and look for high values.</p><p><strong>How it works</strong>: The authors (i) trained image generators, (ii) generated images, and (iii) produced embeddings of those images as well as the training sets. They (iv) broke the embeddings into chunks and (v) detected duplications by comparing embeddings of the generated images with those of the training images.</p><ul><li>First the authors looked for models whose embeddings were effective in detecting duplications. They tested 10 pretrained computer vision architectures on <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4270197?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Sx1nvaahZe38-PWjKtUaD7qc__1GepLnIdt39_cou747ve6R6_mI2mgUTn45sU0V089Fp\" rel=\"noopener\">a</a> <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4587635?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Sx1nvaahZe38-PWjKtUaD7qc__1GepLnIdt39_cou747ve6R6_mI2mgUTn45sU0V089Fp\" rel=\"noopener\">group</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13122?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Sx1nvaahZe38-PWjKtUaD7qc__1GepLnIdt39_cou747ve6R6_mI2mgUTn45sU0V089Fp\" rel=\"noopener\">of</a> <a href=\"https://authors.library.caltech.edu/27452/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Sx1nvaahZe38-PWjKtUaD7qc__1GepLnIdt39_cou747ve6R6_mI2mgUTn45sU0V089Fp\" rel=\"noopener\">five</a> <a href=\"http://123.57.42.89/instre/home.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Sx1nvaahZe38-PWjKtUaD7qc__1GepLnIdt39_cou747ve6R6_mI2mgUTn45sU0V089Fp\" rel=\"noopener\">datasets</a> for image retrieval — a task selected because the training sets include duplications — and five synthetic datasets that contain replications.

The authors split these embeddings into many smaller, evenly sized chunks.

The score was the maximum value of the dot products.</li><li>To test their method under conditions closer to real-world use, the authors performed similar experiments on a pretrained <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Sx1nvaahZe38-PWjKtUaD7qc__1GepLnIdt39_cou747ve6R6_mI2mgUTn45sU0V089Fp\" rel=\"noopener\">Stable Diffusion</a>.

They produced embeddings of the generated images and the LAION Aesthetics. They split these embeddings and compared their dot products.</li></ul><p><strong>Results</strong>: For each generated image, the authors found the 20 most similar images in the training set (that is, those whose fragmented embeddings yielded the highest dot products). Inspecting those images, they determined that the diffusion model sometimes copied elements from the training set. They plotted histograms of the similarity between images within a training set and the similarity between training images and generated images. The more the two histograms overlapped, the fewer the replications they expected to find. Both histograms and visual inspection indicated that models trained on smaller datasets contained more replications. However, on tests with Stable Diffusion, 1.88 percent of generated images had a similarity score greater than 0.5. Above that threshold, the authors observed obvious replications — despite that model’s pretraining on a large dataset.</p><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: Does training an image generator on artworks without permission from the copyright holder violate the copyright? If the image generator literally copies the work, then the answer would seem to be “yes.” Such issues are being tested in court. This work moves the discussion forward by proposing a more sensitive measure of similarity between training and generated images.</p><p><strong>We're thinking: </strong>Picasso allegedly said that good artists borrow while great artists steal. . . .</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong>Elon Musk founded a presumed AI company called X.AI</strong><br>X.AI Corp was incorporated in Nevada last month and Musk is its only listed director.
