In this way, the model increased its chance of generating, over many tries, at least one correct program.</li><li>They fine-tuned a second transformer to generate test-case inputs given a problem description.</li><li>At inference, they randomly sampled a difficulty and suggested techniques, and they told the first transformer to generate a correct solution. They repeated this 1 million times and filtered out programs that failed to solve all test cases. This left thousands of programs.</li><li>To filter the programs further, they used the second transformer to generate 50 test-case inputs and ran the remaining programs on those 50 inputs. Then they clustered programs that produced the same outputs and randomly picked one from each of the 10 largest clusters. This procedure yielded 10 diverse programs to be entered into a contest.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors used AlphaCode in 10 simulated Codeforces competitions, allowing it two hours to generate solutions for each. Ranking its performance among 5,000 Codeforces competitors, it averaged in the 54th percentile (lower is better). It correctly solved 34.2 percent of problems in the validation set.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> AlphaCode generated 1 million possible solutions and culled the bad ones to solve problems it had never seen before and beat a substantial portion of competitive human programmers. It goes to show that there are still benefits to be gained from scaling up.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>AlphaCode is an impressive demonstration of high-throughput code generation and testing.

They were tested on 25 tasks, including classifying objects, classifying the orientation of objects, and diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, after fine-tuning via few-shot learning or transfer learning.

Then they repeated the steps above.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Higher pretrained accuracy generally yielded higher fine-tuned accuracy — but it reached a point of diminishing returns. In some cases, higher pretrained accuracy yielded worse fine-tuned accuracy. Moreover, pretrained models of equal accuracy didn’t necessarily perform equally well on different fine-tuned tasks. The authors’ own experiments matched the curves they derived from earlier work, leading them to conclude that dataset size, number of parameters in a model, and length of training don’t significantly influence the relationship between pretrained and fine-tuned accuracy.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> More pretraining doesn’t necessarily result in a better fine-tuned model.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> One limiting factor in the value of pretraining accuracy may be the relevance of the pretrained task to the fine-tuned task. No matter how well a model classifies ImageNet, it may not easily learn how to diagnose medical images. A rigorous framework for managing the tradeoff between pretraining and fine-tuning would be useful.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table class=\"hse-image-wrapper\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px !important;\"><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(59, 59, 59); word-break: break-word; text-align: center; padding: 5px 0px 10px; font-size: 0px;\"><img alt=\"REMOTE\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/5871640/hubfs/REMOTE.gif?upscale=true&amp;width=1200&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=REMOTE.gif\" width=\"600\" align=\"middle\" class=\"stretch-on-mobile\" style=\"outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width: 100%; font-size: 16px;\"></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"no-hardhat-required\">No Hardhat Required</h1><p>Workers can operate a forklift in their pajamas and never leave their bedrooms, thanks to a new generation of AI-assisted robots.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Companies are pairing semi-autonomous vehicles with remote human operators to execute tasks that the vehicles can’t handle on their own, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/now-physical-jobs-going-remote/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PUaPdFwzA93u4gyBFfy4T6jwYZDB78VEzeo3Tpxq-APICrcxysEIQ5bRqM2_zEg9j-ZPN\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Wired</em></a> reported.<br><br><strong>Distance driving:</strong> Robots that use AI to navigate around warehouses or perform manual labor can encounter situations that weren’t well represented in their training data.
