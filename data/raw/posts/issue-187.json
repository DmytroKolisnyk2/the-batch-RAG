Voice cloning, another generative AI technology, has fooled people into giving large sums of money to scammers, as you can read below in this issue of </em>The Batch<em>. Why don’t we watermark AI-generated content to make it easy to distinguish from human-generated content? Wouldn’t that make ChatGPT-enabled cheating harder and voice cloning less of a threat? While watermarking can help, unfortunately financial incentives in the competitive market for generative AI make their adoption challenging.</em></p><p><em>Effective watermarking technology exists. OpenAI has talked about developing it to detect text produced by ChatGPT, and this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomgoldsteincs/status/1618287665006403585?lang=en&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">tweet storm</a> describes one approach. Similarly, a watermark can be applied invisibly to generated images or audio. While it may be possible to circumvent these watermarks (for instance, by erasing them), they certainly would pose a barrier to AI-generated content that masquerades as human-generated.</em></p><p><em>Unfortunately, I’m not optimistic that this solution will gain widespread adoption. Numerous providers are racing to provide text-, image-, and voice-generation services. If one of them watermarks its output, it will risk imposing on itself a competitive disadvantage (even if it may make society as a whole better off).</em></p><p><em>For example, assuming that search engines downranked AI-generated text, SEO marketers who wanted to produce high-ranking content would have a clear incentive to make sure their text wasn’t easily identifiable as generated. Similarly, a student who made unauthorized use of a text generator to do their homework would like it to be difficult for the teacher to find out.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/unnamed--27--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"First mill-brand watermarked paper with the text &quot;Old Council Tree Bond 100% Cotton Fiber&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/unnamed--27--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/unnamed--27--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/unnamed--27--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Even if a particular country were to mandate watermarking of AI-generated content, the global nature of competition in this market likely would incentivize providers in other countries to ignore that law and keep generating human-like output without watermarking.</em></p><p><em>Some companies likely will whitewash these issues by talking about developing watermarking technology without actually implementing it. An alternative to watermarking is to use machine learning to classify text as either AI- or human-generated. However, systems like <a href=\"https://gptzero.me/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">GPTzero</a> that attempt to do so have a high error rate and don’t provide a robust solution.</em></p><p><em>If one company were to establish a monopoly or near-monopoly, then it would have the market power to implement watermarking without risking losing significant market share. Given the many downsides of monopolies, this is absolutely not the outcome we should hope for.</em></p><p><em>So what’s next? I think we’re entering an era when, in many circumstances, it will be practically impossible to tell if a piece of content is human- or AI-generated. We will need to figure out how to re-architect both human systems such as schools and computer systems such as biometric security to operate in this new — and sometimes exciting — reality. Years ago when Photoshop was new, we learned what images to trust and not trust. With generative AI, we have another set of discoveries ahead of us.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"deeplearningai-exclusive\">DeepLearning.AI Exclusive</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/blog/gerry-patia-machine-learning-success-story/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--8-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Machine Learning Engineer Gerry Patia sitting on his desk\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--8-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--8-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/03/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--8-.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--8-.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><h1 id=\"working-ai-hackathon-hero\">Working AI: Hackathon Hero</h1><p>Gerry Fernando Patia didn’t come from a privileged background or attend a big-name university.

You can see examples and request access <a href=\"https://research.runwayml.com/gen1?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Key insight: </strong>A video can be considered to have what the authors call <em>structure</em> (shapes and how they move) and <em>content</em> (the appearance of each shape including its color, lighting, and style). A video generator can learn to encode structure and content in separate embeddings. At inference, given a clip, it can replace the content embedding to produce a video with the same structure but different content.</p><p><strong>How it works: </strong>Gen-1 generates video frames much like a diffusion model, and the authors trained it following the typical diffusion-model training procedure: Add to each training example varying amounts of noise — nearly up to 100 percent — then train the model to remove it. To generate a video frame, the model starts with 100 percent noise and, guided by a text prompt or image, removes it over several steps. The system used three embeddings: (i) a frame embedding for each video frame (to which noise was added and removed), (ii) a structure embedding for each video frame, and (iii) a content embedding for the entire clip. The dataset comprised 6.4 million eight-frame videos and 240 million images, which the system treated as single-frame videos.</p><ul><li>During training, given an input video, the encoder component of a pretrained <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">autoencoder</a> produced a frame embedding for each video frame. The authors added a consistent amount of noise to each frame embedding.</li><li>Given a video frame, a pretrained <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01341?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">MiDaS</a> extracted a depth map, an image that outlines shapes without colors — in other words, the video frame’s structure. The encoder embedded the depth map to produce a structure embedding for each frame.</li><li>Given one video frame selected at random, a pretrained <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">CLIP</a>, which maps corresponding text and images to the same embedding, created a content embedding. The authors used a single content embedding for the entire video, rather than one for each frame, to ensure that it didn’t determine the structure of each frame.</li><li>Given the frame embeddings (with added noise), structure embeddings, and single content embedding, a modified <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">U-Net</a> learned to estimate the added noise.</li><li>At inference, CLIP received a text prompt or image and generated its own embedding. This replaced the content embedding. For each video frame to be generated, the system received a random — that is, 100 percent noise — frame embedding. Given the noisy frame embeddings, the structure embeddings, and CLIP’s embedding, the U-Net removed the noise over several steps.</li><li>Given the denoised embeddings, the decoder constructed the video frames.</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>Five human evaluators compared Gen-1 to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01073?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">SDEdit</a>, which alters each frame individually. Testing 35 prompts, the evaluators judged Gen-1’s output to better reflect the text 75 percent of the time.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Using different embeddings to represent different aspects of data gives Gen-1 control over the surface characteristics of shapes in a frame without affecting the shapes themselves. The same idea may be useful in manipulating other media types. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/google-introduces-an-ai-that-generates-music-from-text/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">MusicLM</a> extracted separate embeddings for large-scale composition and instrumental details. A Gen-1-type system might impose one musical passage’s composition over another’s instruments.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>Gen-1 doesn’t allow changes in objects in a frame, such as switching the type of flower in a vase, but it does a great job of retaining the shapes of objects while changing the overall scenery. The authors put this capability to especially imaginative use when they transformed books standing upright on a table into urban skyscrapers.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/unnamed--43-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Romania's flags as a neural network\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/unnamed--43-.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/unnamed--43-.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/unnamed--43-.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"deep-learning-state\">Deep (Learning) State</h1><p>Meet the Romanian government’s automated political adviser.<br><br><strong>What’s new: </strong>The Prime Minister of Romania launched <a href=\"https://ion.gov.ro/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ION</a>, a system that summarizes and organizes public comments for cabinet ministers, <em>Politico.eu</em> <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/meet-the-first-ai-presidential-advisor-romanian-pm-says-nicolae-ciuca-nicu-sebe-kris-shrishak/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Romanian citizens can submit comments via a website or by embellishing Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram posts with the tag @noisuntemION (“we are ION”).

However, systems that influence policy remain largely experimental. For instance, Salesforce engineers <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/tax-relief-the-ai-way/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">trained</a> a model to create a tax policy that promoted general income equality and productivity more effectively than the current United States tax code.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Politicians and policymakers must often interpret the will of the people through polls, press reports, or lobbyists. Romania’s experiment may tell officials more directly what constituents want.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Many companies analyze social media to understand customer sentiment; for instance, clustering tweets to see what people are saying about a brand. Policymakers' embrace of a similar approach is a welcome step.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong>Research group EleutherAI plans to launch a nonprofit institute backed by AI startups and industry leaders</strong><br>The EleutherAI Institute aims to contribute to open source AI research through donations and grants from major backers like Hugging Face and Canva.
