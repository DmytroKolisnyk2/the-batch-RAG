Given a complex task like writing software, a multi-agent approach would break down the task into subtasks to be executed by different roles — such as a software engineer, product manager, designer, QA (quality assurance) engineer, and so on — and have different agents accomplish different subtasks.</p><p>Different agents might be built by prompting one LLM (or, if you prefer, multiple LLMs) to carry out different tasks. For example, to build a software engineer agent, we might prompt the LLM: “You are an expert in writing clear, efficient code. Write code to perform the task . . ..”&nbsp;</p><p>It might seem counterintuitive that, although we are making multiple calls to the same LLM, we apply the programming abstraction of using multiple agents. I’d like to offer a few reasons:</p><ul><li>It works! Many teams are getting good results with this method, and there’s nothing like results! Further, ablation studies (for example, in the AutoGen paper cited below) show that multiple agents give superior performance to a single agent.&nbsp;</li><li>Even though some LLMs today can accept very long input contexts (for instance, Gemini 1.5 Pro accepts 1 million tokens), their ability to truly understand long, complex inputs is mixed. An agentic workflow in which the LLM is prompted to focus on one thing at a time can give better performance. By telling it when it should play software engineer, we can also specify what is important in that role’s subtask. For example, the prompt above emphasized clear, efficient code as opposed to, say, scalable and highly secure code. By decomposing the overall task into subtasks, we can optimize the subtasks better.</li><li>Perhaps most important, the multi-agent design pattern gives us, as developers, a framework for breaking down complex tasks into subtasks. When writing code to run on a single CPU, we often break our program up into different processes or threads. This is a useful abstraction that lets us decompose a task, like implementing a web browser, into subtasks that are easier to code. I find thinking through multi-agent roles to be a useful abstraction as well.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/04/unnamed---2024-04-17T155856.845-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Proposed ChatDev architecture, illustrated.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/unnamed---2024-04-17T155856.845-1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/unnamed---2024-04-17T155856.845-1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/04/unnamed---2024-04-17T155856.845-1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>In many companies, managers routinely decide what roles to hire, and then how to split complex projects — like writing a large piece of software or preparing a research report — into smaller tasks to assign to employees with different specialties. Using multiple agents is analogous. Each agent implements its own workflow, has its own memory (itself a rapidly evolving area in agentic technology: how can an agent remember enough of its past interactions to perform better on upcoming ones?), and may ask other agents for help. Agents can also engage in Planning and Tool Use. This results in a cacophony of LLM calls and message passing between agents that can result in very complex workflows.&nbsp;</p><p>While managing people is hard, it's a sufficiently familiar idea that it gives us a mental framework for how to \"hire\" and assign tasks to our AI agents. Fortunately, the damage from mismanaging an AI agent is much lower than that from mismanaging humans!&nbsp;</p><p>Emerging frameworks like AutoGen, Crew AI, and LangGraph, provide rich ways to build multi-agent solutions to problems.

The store lists GPTs in several categories, such as Writing, Productivity, Programming, and Lifestyle. While many are useful, some are questionable.</p><ul><li>Some GPTs purported to jailbreak ChatGPT. In&nbsp;<em>TechCrunch</em>’s survey, some of them were able to circumvent OpenAI’s own guardrails. Since then, they have been tamed. The GPT Store’s terms of use prohibit efforts to thwart OpenAI’s safeguards and safety measures.</li><li>GPTs like Humanizer Pro, the second-ranked instance in the Writing category at the time of writing, purport to rewrite text and make it undetectable to programs designed to detect generated text. These GPTs may violate OpenAI’s ban on GPTs that enable academic dishonesty.</li><li>Many GPTs purport to allow users to chat with trademarked characters without clear authorization from the trademark owners. The store prohibits use of content owned by third parties without their permission.</li><li>Other GPTs purport to represent real-life figures such as Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Joe Rogan, or companies such as Microsoft and Apple (many of them obviously satirical). OpenAI allows GPTs to respond in the style of a real person if they do not impersonate that person. However, many such GPTs don’t indicate that they are not associated with the genuine person.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong>&nbsp;OpenAI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/openai-releases-the-gpt-store-a-curated-chatbot-marketplace/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8TZzur2df1qdnGx09b-Fg94DTsc3-xXao4StKvKNU2HR51el3n8yOm0CPSw6GiAoLQNKua\" rel=\"noopener\">launched</a>&nbsp;the GPT Store in January. Since then, users have uploaded more than 3 million GPTs that include enhanced search engines, creative writing aids, and tools that produce short videos.

How OpenAI moderates the store may have real financial and reputational impacts on developers in the years ahead.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;The GPT Store’s low barrier to entry is a boon to well-meaning developers, but it may encourage less responsible actors to take advantage of lax moderation.

A separate retrieval model computes the probability that each chunk of text in a separate dataset is relevant to the prompt.
