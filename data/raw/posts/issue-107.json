I’ve heard of two styles:</em></p><ul><li><em>Ready, Aim, Fire: Plan carefully and carry out due diligence. Commit and execute only when you have a high degree of confidence in a direction.</em></li><li><em>Ready, Fire, Aim: Jump into development and start executing. This allows you to discover problems quickly and pivot along the way if necessary.</em></li></ul><p><em>Say you’ve built a customer-service chatbot for retailers, and you think it could help restaurants, too. Should you take time to study the restaurant market before starting development, moving slowly but cutting the risk of wasting time and resources? Or jump in right away, moving quickly and accepting a higher risk of pivoting or failing?<br><br>Both approaches have their advocates, but I think the best choice depends on the situation.</em></p><p><em>Ready, Aim, Fire tends to be superior when the cost of execution is high and a study can shed light on how useful or valuable a project could be. For example, if your team can brainstorm a few other use cases (restaurants, airlines, telcos, and so on) and evaluate these cases to identify the most promising one, it may be worth taking the extra time before committing to a direction.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.08.19-PM-copy.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Cartoon with a joke about choices\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.08.19-PM-copy.png 600w\"></figure><p><em>Ready, Fire, Aim tends to be better if you can execute at low cost and, in doing so, determine whether the direction is feasible and discover tweaks that will make it work. For example, if you can build a prototype quickly to figure out if users want the product, and if canceling or pivoting after a small amount of work is acceptable, then it makes sense to consider jumping in quickly. (When taking a shot is inexpensive, it also makes sense to take many shots. In this case, the process is actually Ready, Fire, Aim, Fire, Aim, Fire, Aim, Fire.)</em></p><p><em>After agreeing upon a product direction, when it comes to building a machine learning model that’s part of the product, I have a bias toward Ready, Fire, Aim. Building models is an <a href=\"https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/iteration-in-ai-development/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">iterative process</a>. For many applications, the cost of training and conducting error analysis is not prohibitive. Furthermore, it is very difficult to carry out a study that will shed light on the appropriate model, data, and hyperparameters. So it makes sense to build an end-to-end system quickly and revise it until it works well.<br><br>But when committing to a direction means making a costly investment or entering a <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-this-is-how-successful-people-make-such-smart-decisions.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">one-way door</a> (meaning a decision that’s hard to reverse), it’s often worth spending more time in advance to make sure it really is a good idea.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!<br><br>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h2 id=\"news\">News</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/09/Tesla-Bot.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Person dressed up as Tesla Bot showing some dance moves \" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/09/Tesla-Bot.gif 600w\"></figure><h2 id=\"dances-with-robots\">Dances With Robots</h2><p>Tesla unveiled its own AI chip and — surprise! — plans for a humanoid robot.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> At Tesla’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0z4FweCy4M&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">AI Day</a> promotional event, the company offered a first look at an upcoming self-driving computer powered by custom AI chips. To make sure the event got headlines, CEO Elon Musk teased a forthcoming android.<br><br><strong>Chips and bots:</strong> Company executives explained how the company trains models, labels data, and meets various AI challenges.

Last week, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation into 11 incidents in which Tesla vehicles using Autopilot collided with parked emergency vehicles.

Given a prompt that includes a few example questions and answers (the shots) plus an unanswered question (the task), such models can generate an accurate answer. But there may be more to getting good results.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Ethan Perez, Douwe Kiela, and Kyunghyun Cho subjected GPT-style language models to a test they call <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11447?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">true few-shot learning</a>. They found that the heralded few-shot success may depend on a well engineered prompt. The authors are based at New York University, Facebook, and CIFAR, respectively.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Training a machine-learning model typically requires a validation set to tune hyperparameters such as the learning rate. For GPT-style models, those hyperparameters include the prompt format. In few-shot learning with a pretrained model, the prompt typically contains a handful of examples. However, researchers often experiment extensively to find a prompt format that yields accurate responses. This amounts to stacking the deck in the model’s favor, and without it, such models can’t perform so well.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors evaluated four sizes of GPT-3, four sizes of <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">GPT-2</a>, and <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/distilgpt2?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">DistilGPT-2</a>. They tested prompt formats from <a href=\"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1250/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">LAMA</a>, a benchmark that comprises factual statements in a variety of formats, and <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00324/96460/How-Can-We-Know-What-Language-Models-Know?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">LPAQA</a>, which contains LAMA statements translated from English into a different language and back.</p><ul><li>LAMA provides statements in 41 categories, such as “<em>X</em> was born in <em>Y</em>,” where <em>X</em> is a personal name and <em>Y</em> is a place, and “<em>X</em> was created by <em>Y</em>,” where <em>X</em> is the name of a company and <em>Y</em> is the name of a product. It presents each statement in an average of 12 formats. For instance, “<em>X</em> was created by <em>Y</em>” is also formatted “<em>X</em> is developed by <em>Y</em>” and “<em>X</em> is being developed by <em>Y</em>.”</li><li>The authors assembled prompts made of five such statements, all in the same category and format, in which the last word was missing, such as, “The iPhone is being developed by _.” The missing word is, of course, “Apple.” They provided versions of these prompts in all 120 possible orders of the five statements, always with the final word missing, prompting the model to fill in the blank.</li><li>They used <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">cross-validation</a> to find the prompt format that, given four complete and one incomplete examples, prompted the best performance on average across all formats and categories.</li><li>For each model, they compared performance prompted by the best format according to cross-validation, the format associated with the highest accuracy on the test set, and the mean accuracy on the test set across all formats and categories.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> For all models tested, the accuracy prompted by the format selected according to cross-validation was only marginally above the mean and significantly below the accuracy of the best format. For instance, for the largest model (GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters), the format chosen by cross-validation scored about 55 percent, mean accuracy was about 54 percent, and the accuracy of the best format was about 60 percent.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Previous claims of few-shot learning in GPT-style models left out an important variable: the size of the dataset used to pick a good format. Choosing among 12 prompt formats boosted accuracy by around 5 percent; choosing among a larger set of formats could make a bigger difference.
