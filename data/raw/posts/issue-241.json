The model is available to Covariant customers.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;RFM-1 is a transformer that comprises 8 billion parameters. The team started with a pretrained large language model and further trained it, given text, images, videos, robot actions, and/or robot sensor readings, to predict the next token of any of those types. Images and videos are limited to 512x512 pixels and 5 frames per second.</p><ul><li>Proprietary models embed non-language inputs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>RFM-1 responds conversationally to text and/or image inputs. Given an image of a bin filled with fruit and the question “Are there any fruits in the bin?” the model can respond yes or no. If yes, it can answer follow-up questions about the fruit’s type, color, and so on.</li><li>Given a robotic instruction, the model generates tokens that represent a combination of high-level actions and low-level commands. For example, asked to “pick all the red apples,” it generates the tokens required to pluck the apples from a bin.</li><li>If the robot is unable to fulfill an instruction, the model can ask for further direction. For instance, in one demonstration, it asks, “I cannot get a good grasp. Do you have any suggestions?” When the operator responds, “move 2 cm from the top of the object and knock it over gently,” the robot knocks over the item and automatically finds a new way to pick it up.</li><li>RFM-1 can predict future video frames. For example, if the model is instructed to remove a particular item from a bin, prior to removing the item, it can generate an image of the bin with the item missing.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong>&nbsp;Covariant’s announcement follows a wave of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03094?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QGCoaEh42QGUTnfoPl5an-ds0dVuJeNXLRxVO4h72DKVH187SV0hJ06VkEN-DlSHanUDK\" rel=\"noopener\">robotics</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06252?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QGCoaEh42QGUTnfoPl5an-ds0dVuJeNXLRxVO4h72DKVH187SV0hJ06VkEN-DlSHanUDK\" rel=\"noopener\">research</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15818?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QGCoaEh42QGUTnfoPl5an-ds0dVuJeNXLRxVO4h72DKVH187SV0hJ06VkEN-DlSHanUDK\" rel=\"noopener\">in</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02005?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QGCoaEh42QGUTnfoPl5an-ds0dVuJeNXLRxVO4h72DKVH187SV0hJ06VkEN-DlSHanUDK\" rel=\"noopener\">recent</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://proceedings.mlr.press/v205/shridhar23a/shridhar23a.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QGCoaEh42QGUTnfoPl5an-ds0dVuJeNXLRxVO4h72DKVH187SV0hJ06VkEN-DlSHanUDK\" rel=\"noopener\">years</a>&nbsp;that enables robots to take action in response to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openreview.net/pdf?id=U0jfsqmoV-4&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QGCoaEh42QGUTnfoPl5an-ds0dVuJeNXLRxVO4h72DKVH187SV0hJ06VkEN-DlSHanUDK\" rel=\"noopener\">text</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01115?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QGCoaEh42QGUTnfoPl5an-ds0dVuJeNXLRxVO4h72DKVH187SV0hJ06VkEN-DlSHanUDK\" rel=\"noopener\">instructions</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Giving robots the ability to respond to natural language input not only makes them easier to control, it also enables them to interact with humans in new ways that are surprising and useful.

However, a more-expensive LLM may produce satisfactory output more consistently. Thus, using multiple models selectively can save substantially on processing costs. If we arrange LLMs from least to most expensive, we can start with the least expensive one. A separate model can evaluate its output, and if it’s unsatisfactory, another algorithm can automatically call a more expensive LLM, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors used a suite of 12 commercial LLMs, a model that evaluated their output, and an algorithm that selected and ordered them. At the time, the LLMs’ costs (which are subject to change) spanned two orders of magnitude: GPT-4 cost $30/$60 per 1 million tokens of input/output, while GPT-J hosted by Textsynth cost $0.20/$5 per 10 million tokens of input/output.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>To classify an LLM’s output as satisfactory or unsatisfactory, the authors fine-tuned separate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QGCoaEh42QGUTnfoPl5an-ds0dVuJeNXLRxVO4h72DKVH187SV0hJ06VkEN-DlSHanUDK\" rel=\"noopener\">DistilBERTs</a>&nbsp;on a diverse selection of datasets:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04202?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QGCoaEh42QGUTnfoPl5an-ds0dVuJeNXLRxVO4h72DKVH187SV0hJ06VkEN-DlSHanUDK\" rel=\"noopener\">one</a>&nbsp;that paired news headlines and subsequent changes in the price of gold,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08671?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QGCoaEh42QGUTnfoPl5an-ds0dVuJeNXLRxVO4h72DKVH187SV0hJ06VkEN-DlSHanUDK\" rel=\"noopener\">another</a>&nbsp;that labeled excerpts from court documents according to whether they rejected a legal precedent, and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07042?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QGCoaEh42QGUTnfoPl5an-ds0dVuJeNXLRxVO4h72DKVH187SV0hJ06VkEN-DlSHanUDK\" rel=\"noopener\">third</a>&nbsp;dataset of questions and answers. Given an input/output pair (such as a question and answer), they fine-tuned DistilBERT to produce a high score if the output was correct and low score if it wasn’t. The output was deemed satisfactory if its score exceeded a threshold.</li><li>A custom algorithm (which the authors don’t describe in detail) learned to choose three LLMs and put them in order. For each dataset, it maximized the percentage of times a sequence of three LLMs generated the correct output within a set budget.&nbsp;</li><li>The first LLM received an input. If its output was unsatisfactory, the second LLM received the input. If the second LLM’s output was unsatisfactory, the third LLM received the input.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;For each of the three datasets, the authors found the accuracy of each LLM. Then they found the cost for FrugalGPT to match that accuracy. Relative to the most accurate LLM, FrugalGPT saved 98.3 percent, 73.3 percent, and 59.2 percent, respectively.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Many teams choose a single model to balance cost and quality (and perhaps speed). This approach offers a way to save money without sacrificing performance.</p><p><strong>We're thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Not all queries require a GPT-4-class model. Now we can pick the right model for the right prompt.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p>Find more AI news of the week in <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/tag/data-points/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Data Points</a>, including:&nbsp;</p><p>◆ AI takes over hockey and racing<br>◆ An advanced brain surgery assistant<br>◆ Google’s measures for the Indian General Election<br>◆ OpenAI’s licensing agreement with Le Monde and Prisa&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/data-points-issue-241/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Read Data Points now</a>.</p>","comment_id":"65fb55e44ab76700012f3f89","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/03/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2024-03-20T192329.626.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2024-03-20T14:32:20.000-07:00","updated_at":"2024-03-27T10:11:00.000-07:00","published_at":"2024-03-20T14:41:36.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"The Batch AI News and Insights: I think AI agent workflows will drive massive AI progress this year — perhaps even more than the next generation of foundation models.
