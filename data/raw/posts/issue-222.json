Bearing in mind the importance of responsible AI, I respect leaders and teams that make decisions and execute quickly. In contrast, I’ve also seen companies where shipping a feature can require 3 months for legal, marketing, and privacy review. Systemically forcing yourself to make a decision quickly rather than calling another meeting to talk about a topic some more (unless it’s really necessary) can push an organization to move faster.</em></p><p><em>When you move fast, not everything will work out. For example, when OpenAI launches so many new features (including highly innovative ones like the GPT store, where developers can distribute special-purpose chatbots as though they were mobile apps), it’s possible that not every one of them will take off. But the sheer speed and volume of execution makes it likely that some of these bets will pay off handsomely. And not only for OpenAI, but also for developers who use the new features to build new products.</em></p><p><em>If you’re a developer, the rapidly growing set of tools at your disposal gives you an opportunity to execute quickly and build things that have never existed before, largely because the tools to build them didn’t exist.

It extended API access to its DALL·E 3 image generator, text-to-speech engine, speech recognition, and agent-style capabilities. And it showed off a new concept in chatbots called GPTs.</p><ul><li>GPT-4 Turbo expands the number of tokens (typically words or parts of words) the model can process at once to 128,000 — &nbsp;up from a previous maximum of 32,000. That enables the model to process context over the length of a book. API access costs between one-third and half the previous cost of GPT-4 Turbo’s predecessors (some of which got price cuts).</li><li>GPT-4 Turbo includes a JSON mode that returns valid JSON, enabling developers to get usable structured data from a single API call. Reproducible outputs (in beta) make the model’s behavior more consistent from one use to another by letting users specify a random number seed. Log probabilities (available soon) will allow developers to build features like autocomplete by predicting which tokens are likely to appear next in a sequence.</li><li>New API calls enable developers to take advantage of image input/output, text-to-speech, and speech recognition (coming soon). New calls are available for building agent-style applications that can reason about and execute sequences of actions to complete a task. They can also retrieve information external to the model and execute functions.</li><li>The company introduced GPTs: custom chatbots that can be configured using a conversational interface and distributed in store, like mobile apps. For instance, Canva built a GPT that generates graphics to order through conversation.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;OpenAI is enabling developers to build intelligence into an ever wider range of applications. GPT-4 Turbo's 128,000-token context window makes possible applications that require tracking information across huge volumes of input. The expanded APIs open up language, vision, and multimodal capabilities as well as agent-style applications that respond to changing conditions and behave in complex ways. The opportunities for developers are immense.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;It’s amazing to see cutting-edge AI developments become widely available so quickly.

In general, the consecutive names produced by people with schizophrenia would be less semantically related than those produced by others.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors asked 26 people who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and 26 people who hadn’t to name as many animals as they could in five minutes. They also asked the subjects to name as many words that start with the letter “P” as they could in five minutes.</p><ul><li>The authors analyzed the randomness of the lists by comparing them to an “optimal” order based on embeddings generated by a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fasttext.cc/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Msf16vGwhyigrzzrYjXsLovIpqpjOPau6DWc_iWzSn3tY5quR1k7A9stq83Vgz3ANrWE3\" rel=\"noopener\">fastText</a>&nbsp;model that was pretrained on text from the web.

The training method known as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Msf16vGwhyigrzzrYjXsLovIpqpjOPau6DWc_iWzSn3tY5quR1k7A9stq83Vgz3ANrWE3\" rel=\"noopener\">SimCLR</a>&nbsp;uses a contrastive loss with two augmented (cropped, rotated, flipped, and so on) versions of each image, so a model learns that augmented versions of one image, which is closely related but different, are similar to one another — but not to augmented versions of other images. Given a prompt, an image generator produces images that are closely related but significantly more different than augmented versions of the same image. This makes for greater variety among similar examples, which can lead to more effective learning using a contrastive loss.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors generated images and trained a vision transformer on them using a contrastive loss.</p><ul><li>The authors used Stable Diffusion to generate 2.7 million images. They drew the prompts from the captions in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Msf16vGwhyigrzzrYjXsLovIpqpjOPau6DWc_iWzSn3tY5quR1k7A9stq83Vgz3ANrWE3\" rel=\"noopener\">Conceptual Captions</a>&nbsp;(a dataset of images and captions) and asked Stable Diffusion to generate 10 images of each prompt.&nbsp;</li><li>They augmented each generated image according to SimCLR, but only once.</li><li>They trained a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929v2?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Msf16vGwhyigrzzrYjXsLovIpqpjOPau6DWc_iWzSn3tY5quR1k7A9stq83Vgz3ANrWE3\" rel=\"noopener\">ViT-B/16</a>&nbsp;to generate a similar embedding for the augmented version of each image generated from the same prompt, and a dissimilar embedding for the augmented version of each image generated from other prompts.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors compared the ViT-B/16 trained using StableRep to two models of the same architecture trained using SimCLR (one using generated images, the other using images from Conceptual Captions). They also compared it to two CLIP models that produced matching embeddings for images and their paired captions, one trained on generated images and their prompts, the other on real images and their captions. For each of 11 computer vision datasets, the authors trained a linear classifier on top of each model without changing the model’s weights. Comparing the classifiers’ performance, StableRep achieved the best results on 9 of them. For example, on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5151?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Msf16vGwhyigrzzrYjXsLovIpqpjOPau6DWc_iWzSn3tY5quR1k7A9stq83Vgz3ANrWE3\" rel=\"noopener\">FGVC-Aircraft</a>&nbsp;(10,000 images of 100 different aircraft), StableRep achieved 57.6 percent accuracy, while the best competing model, CLIP pretrained on generated images, scored 53.5 percent.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:&nbsp;</strong>The fact that text-to-image generators can produce images of similar things that are quite different in appearance makes them a powerful resource for training vision models.&nbsp;And they provide a practically unlimited source of such images!</p><p><strong>We're thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Different foundation models understand different aspects of the world. It’s exciting that a large diffusion model, which is good at generating images, can be used to train a large vision transformer, which is good at analyzing images!</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-fourthbrain\">A MESSAGE FROM FOURTHBRAIN</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--78-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--78-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--78-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--78-.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--78-.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Join us for two live workshops!
