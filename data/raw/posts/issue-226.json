So a generic LVM (usually a large vision transformer trained using a self-supervised learning objective on unlabeled images scraped from the internet) learns to recognize salient features in such images.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>But many industry-specific applications of computer vision involve images that look little like internet images. Pathology applications, for instance, process images of tissue samples captured using high-powered microscopes. Alternatively, manufacturing inspection applications might work with numerous images centered on a single object or part of an object, all of which were imaged under similar lighting and camera configurations.</em></p><p><em>While some pathology and some manufacturing images can be found on the internet, their relative scarcity means that most generic LVMs do poorly at recognizing the most important features in such images.</em>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/12/unnamed--77-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Visualization of features of a pathology image using a generic LVM (left) versus a domain-specific LVM (right)\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/unnamed--77-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/unnamed--77-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/12/unnamed--77-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>In experiments conducted by Landing AI's Mark Sabini, Abdelhamid Bouzid, and Bastian Renjifo, LVMs adapted to images of a particular domain, such as pathology or semiconductor wafer inspection, do much better at finding relevant features in images of that domain.

If we want to track objects over time, a recurrent model could predict the locations of objects using a separate graph for each time step, but that would require a prohibitive number of graphs. Instead, a model can predict locations using a single graph in which each edge is annotated, additionally, with the time elapsed since the associated object was seen in the associated location. The model learns to predict the next most likely place to find an object based on the object’s most recent, frequent, and longstanding locations.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors simulated a robot looking for things in a household. They built (i) a simulator of houses, object locations, and when and where they moved; (ii) a graph that represented a house containing objects; and (iii) a machine learning system that predicted where objects might be found.</p><ul><li>The simulator presented a household in which objects moved randomly over time — as if people were moving them — according to predefined probabilities. For example, a mug might move from a cabinet to a table. At each time step, a simulated robot observed one piece of furniture and the objects on or inside it.</li><li>The robot represented its observations as a graph. The nodes included rooms, furniture, and objects, while edges connected each object to every piece of furniture and every piece of furniture to a room. The node and edge embeddings represented the robot’s past observations; for example, where it last saw the mug, time elapsed since that observation, and how many times it had seen the mug there.&nbsp;</li><li>The authors simulated the robot moving through 100 households with various floor plans. They built a training set of 10,000 graphs.</li><li>They trained the machine learning system to predict whether an object was on/in a given piece of furniture (that is, whether an edge connected a given object and location at the current timestep). The system embedded previously observed nodes and edges using a separate vanilla neural network for each, concatenated the embeddings, and fed them to a graph neural network followed by a two-layer transformer. A vanilla neural network at the end of the transformer generated probabilities for all edges that connected a given object to various pieces of furniture.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors tested their system’s ability to find a single object in a house versus a few baseline methods. The baselines included random guessing, always guessing the piece of furniture where the object was last seen, and a Bayesian model that guessed whether the object was on/in a given piece of furniture based on the percentage of times it had been seen there. On average, their system found the object in 3.2 attempts, while the next best model (Bayesian) took 3.6 attempts. Guessing the last-seen location required 6.0 attempts, and random guessing required 8.8 attempts.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Feature engineering helps to find the best way to represent data so a model can learn from it. In this work, engineering time-related features (such as the time elapsed since an object was on a piece of furniture or the number of times an object was observed on a piece of furniture over time) enabled a non-recurrent model to learn how graphs change over time.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;A physical robot likely would use object detection on its camera feed instead of a simulator that told it directly which objects were associated with which pieces of furniture. We look forward to future work that proves the concept using this more realistic setup.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong>Microsoft announces £2.5 billion investment to boost the UK’s AI capabilities</strong><br>The investment aims to double Microsoft’s UK datacenter footprint by 2026, train or retrain over one million people for the AI economy, and extend Microsoft’s Accelerating Foundation Models Research (AFMR) program to prioritize GPU access for the UK’s research community.
