It focused on three data sources:</p><ul><li><strong>Satellite images:</strong> The researchers adapted <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.03685.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">SolarNet</a>, an image recognition model that maps solar panels based on infrared satellite photos, to look for heat signatures from steel mills. Then they correlated the results with steel output. In late January, at the height of the outbreak, China’s steel production had dropped to 30 percent of capacity, they found. By February 9, it had recovered to 76 percent.</li><li><strong>GPS:</strong> Using a different model, the researchers analyzed anonymized GPS signals collected in 2019 from millions of phones to determine whether they belonged to commuters. They used the results to estimate economic activity. Then they analyzed signals surrounding the quarantines to assess the impact. Comparing the datasets, they found that the country’s economic activity had fallen to 20 percent of normal by February 9. A month later, however, it had rebounded to 72 percent. Extrapolating the findings, they predict that China’s economy will recover fully by March 26.</li><li><strong>Social media:</strong> The  researchers used natural language processing to scan social media posts to determine whether people were working from homes or offices. According to that analysis, the number of telecommuters ballooned by more than sixfold between January 1 and mid-March.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> China dramatically <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/china-s-aggressive-measures-have-slowed-coronavirus-they-may-not-work-other-countries?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">cut</a> its coronavirus transmission rate by imposing strict measures to limit social interaction including a quarantine of 50 million people in the province that includes Wuhan, the disease’s epicenter.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Before Covid-19 rocked China’s economy, J.P.  Morgan had estimated that the country’s GDP would grow nearly 6 percent by the end of 2020.

That approach becomes less effective, though, as dangerous bacteria evolve resistance to those very chemical structures. Instead, researchers enlisted neural networks.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Jonathan Stokes and colleagues at MIT, Harvard, and McMaster University built an ensemble model that predicts molecules that are structurally unrelated to known antibiotics, harmless to humans, and deadly to E. coli, a common bacterium that served as a proxy microorganism. The model spotted a previously unrecognized antibiotic that proved effective at killing a variety of germs.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Neural networks can stand in for petri dishes to zero in on promising molecules. An initial simulation reduced an enormous number of molecules to a few thousand solid possibilities, of which the model selected a couple dozen for testing in a wet lab.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers used an ensemble of 20 graph neural networks (GNNs) to evaluate molecules’ ability to inhibit E. coli, and another ensemble of five GNNs to evaluate toxicity. They used a standard measure to evaluate chemical structure. Then they tested the most promising compounds on mice.</p><ul><li>Each GNN examines molecules atom by atom.

Empirical tests on the top-ranked 3,260 chemicals yielded 51 that were effective. Of those, 23 had low predicted toxicity and structures distinct from known antibiotics. In mouse experiments, Halicin, a known diabetes treatment, proved effective as a broad-spectrum antibiotic.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Alexander Fleming’s discovery of penicillin in 1928 revolutionized medicine. Now that transformation is at risk as bugs evolve resistance to that drug and its successors. Discovery of new antibiotics has been hampered by lack of a way to narrow the list of possibilities for lab tests. This method offers a way to vet candidates quickly and efficiently.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Antibiotic-resistant bugs are responsible for 2.8 million infections and 35,000 deaths annually in the U.S. alone.

New research estimates the impact of dataset and model sizes on neural network performance.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Jonathan Rosenfeld and colleagues at MIT, York University, Harvard, Neural Magic, and Tel Aviv University introduced an equation — a so-called <a href=\"https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryenvpEKDr&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">error landscape</a> — that predicts how much data and how large a model it takes to generalize well.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> The researchers made some assumptions; for instance, models without training should be as accurate as a random guess. They combined these assumptions with experimental observations to create an equation that works for a variety of architectures, model sizes, data types, and dataset sizes.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers trained various state-of-the-art vision and language models on a number of benchmark datasets. Considering 30 combinations of architecture and dataset, they observed three effects when varying data and model size:</p><ul><li>For a fixed amount of data, increasing model size initially boosted performance on novel data, though effect leveled off. The researchers observed a similar trend as they increased the amount of training data. The effect of boosting both model and dataset size was approximately the same as the combined impact of changing each one individually.</li><li>An equation captures these observations. It describes the error as a function of model and data size, forming a 3D surface or error landscape.</li><li>The equation contains variables dependent on the task. Natural language processing, for instance, often requires more data than image processing. A simple regression can determine their values for a target dataset.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> After fitting dataset-specific variables to the validation dataset, the researchers compared the predicted model error against the true error on the test set. The predictions were within 1 percent of the true error, on average.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It turns out that the impact on accuracy of model and dataset size is predictable. How nice to have an alternative to trial and error!<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> When varying network sizes, the researchers focused mainly on scaling width while holding the rest of the architecture constant. Neural network “size” can’t be captured in a single number, and we look forward to future work that considers this nuance.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Learning theory offers some predictions about how algorithmic performance should scale, but we’re glad to see empirically derived rules of thumb.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Gender20ASPECT201.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Women in AI in academia and industry chart\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"ai%E2%80%99s-gender-imbalance\">AI’s Gender Imbalance</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/markminevich/2020/03/13/top-women-in-ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io#5961827a4515\" rel=\" noopener\">Women</a> continue to be severely underrepresented in AI.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> A <a href=\"https://medium.com/syncedreview/exploring-gender-imbalance-in-ai-numbers-trends-and-discussions-33096879bd54?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">meta-analysis</a> of research conducted by <em>Synced Review</em> for Women’s History Month found that female participation in various aspects of AI typically hovers between 10 and 20 percent.<br><br><strong>What they found:</strong>  Much of the research included in the analysis was based on numbers generated by rules-based software that categorizes names according to gender. <em>Synced Review</em>, which is based in China, said it didn’t examine studies of Chinese companies or institutions because Chinese names don’t correlate as tightly with gender as names in other languages.</p><ul><li>The <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj10986/f/ai_index_2019_report.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">2019 AI Index</a> produced by Stanford University’s Human-Centered AI Institute reported that females made up 20 percent of faculty members in academic AI departments.
