Machine learning is a highly experiment-driven field. Until you’ve built something, it’s hard to predict how well it will work. This creates a unique challenge when you’re trying to inform customers about what they should expect a new product to do.</em></p><p><em>For instance, the entire self-driving industry, which I was once part of, did a poor job of setting expectations about when fully autonomous cars would be ready for widespread deployment. This shortcoming led to elevated expectations that the industry failed to meet.</em></p><p><em>Compared to traditional software that begins with a specification and ends with a deliverable to match, machine learning systems present a variety of unique challenges. These challenges can affect the budget, schedule, and capabilities of a product in unexpected ways.</em></p><p><em>How can you avoid surprising customers? Here’s a non-exhaustive checklist of ways that a machine learning system might surprise customers who are more familiar with traditional software:</em></p><ul><li><em>We don’t know how accurate the system will be in advance.</em></li><li><em>We might need a costly initial data collection phase.</em></li><li><em>After getting the initial dataset, we might come back and ask for more data or better data.</em></li><li><em>Moreover, we might ask for this over and over.</em></li><li><em>After we’ve built a prototype that runs accurately in the lab, it might not run as well in production because of <a href=\"https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/developing-ai-products-part-5-data-drift-concept-drift-and-other-maintenance-issues/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9H55Ayjz_iqco2zBQY2mlfAz-ab6gqplLKURCHGQMGzJUS43ekA1fA5Zfct185eaKPo6Wo\" rel=\"noopener\">data drift or concept drift</a>.</em></li><li><em>Even after we’ve built an accurate production system, its performance might get worse over time for no obvious reason.

It’s best to set expectations with customers clearly before starting a project and keep reminding them throughout the process.</em></p><p><em>As a reader of The Batch, you probably know a fair amount about AI. But AI and machine learning are still very mysterious to most people. Occasionally I speak with executives, even at large companies, whose thinking about AI gravitates more toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) — a system that can learn to perform any mental task that a typical human can — than practical applications in the marketplace today. Entrepreneurs who aspire to build AI systems usually have to work extra hard to convey the significant promise of their solution while avoiding setting elevated expectations that they can’t meet. The fact that we ourselves can incorrectly assess the capabilities of the systems we’re building — which is what happened with self-driving — makes this  even harder.</em></p><p><em>Fortunately, in many application areas, once you’ve acquired one or two happy customers, things get much easier. You can (with permission) show those successes to later customers and, with a couple of successful deployments under your belt, your own sense of what to expect also improves.</em></p><p><em>The first deployment is always hardest, and each subsequent one gets easier.

We don’t find it so interesting that a giant neural network can do what 600 distinct, smaller networks could do. But evidence that Gato might generalize across different tasks is fascinating. Specifically, the authors pretrained Gato, fine-tuned it on four new tasks, and showed that, in three cases, the fine-tuned model outperformed models trained specifically for those tasks. We look forward to more research that evaluates the extent to which such networks, beyond memorizing various unrelated tasks, generalize across tasks and to new tasks.

External software analyzes the data and directs the device to deliver feedback. Supervisors can view the results on a software dashboard.</p><ul><li>The device uses six sensors to monitor, in real time, the user’s posture, movement, and location as well as ambient noise, lighting, temperature, and air quality.</li><li>Machine learning models that run in the cloud assign each user a score. For instance, lifting a heavy object using muscles in the lower back yields a lower score than using leg muscles.</li><li>Given a high score, the system delivers feedback such as a haptic vibration that signals a hazardous motion. It may alert supervisors of danger signs, for instance if a wearer stops moving or air quality degrades.</li><li>The belts are equipped with radio-frequency identification tags, allowing the system to track their locations. The system can send an alert if a worker isn’t wearing a belt in a designated area or if a belt leaves the facility.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Modjoul is one of five companies that <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/introducing-the-1-billion-amazon-industrial-innovation-fund?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9H55Ayjz_iqco2zBQY2mlfAz-ab6gqplLKURCHGQMGzJUS43ekA1fA5Zfct185eaKPo6Wo\" rel=\"noopener\">received </a>investments last week from Amazon’s Industrial Innovation Fund. Several are developing AI products. For instance, California-based Vimaan is building a computer vision system to track inventories in real time by scanning barcodes, expiration dates, and serial numbers. BionicHIVE, an Israeli startup, is working on robots that use cameras and other sensors to track the locations of products on warehouse shelves.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> AI holds potential to make traditional industries more efficient and hopefully more humane. This system’s ability to recognize hazards related to physical posture means that everyone on the factory floor can benefit from moment-to-moment ergonomic evaluation. Protecting workers from injury is a win-win for employers and employees.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Monitoring workers raises obvious concerns about privacy and fairness. While we hope that employers will use such technology to improve the lives of workers, we also see potential for abuse by managers who, say, aim to maximize productivity at the cost of driving people to exhaustion. Automated monitoring of worker performance demands clear policies that govern its use, periodic auditing that documents its benefits and exposes its harms, and transparent mechanisms that make employers accountable for its impacts. Amazon is in an ideal position to take the lead in developing such policies and procedures.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <strong><a href=\"http://deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></strong></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/05/DeepLearningAI_Banner_Stanford_Teaser_1200x628_Artboard-2--1--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1047\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/DeepLearningAI_Banner_Stanford_Teaser_1200x628_Artboard-2--1--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/DeepLearningAI_Banner_Stanford_Teaser_1200x628_Artboard-2--1--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/05/DeepLearningAI_Banner_Stanford_Teaser_1200x628_Artboard-2--1--1.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/05/DeepLearningAI_Banner_Stanford_Teaser_1200x628_Artboard-2--1--1.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Looking to get a certification to launch your machine learning career? #BreakIntoAI with the updated Machine Learning Specialization, launching in June on Coursera! <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/machine-learning-specialization/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Sign up to be notified</a></p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/05/LocationEtcData.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"US map with locations of Planned Parenthood\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/05/LocationEtcData.webp 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"when-data-danger\">When Data = Danger</h1><p>Amid rising social tension in the United States over reproductive freedom, a company that analyzes location data on abortion clinics stopped distributing its findings after a critical press report.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> SafeGraph, a company that analyzes consumer behavior based on location data, provided anonymized data on locations of Planned Parenthood, a chain of clinics that offer family-planning services including abortion, <em>Vice </em><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vzjb/location-data-abortion-clinics-safegraph-planned-parenthood?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9H55Ayjz_iqco2zBQY2mlfAz-ab6gqplLKURCHGQMGzJUS43ekA1fA5Zfct185eaKPo6Wo\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>.

New work modifies these architectures to run more efficiently while adopting helpful properties from convolutions.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Pranav Jeevan P and Amit Sethi at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay proposed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10271?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9H55Ayjz_iqco2zBQY2mlfAz-ab6gqplLKURCHGQMGzJUS43ekA1fA5Zfct185eaKPo6Wo\" rel=\"noopener\">Convolutional Xformers for Vision </a>(CXV), a suite of revamped vision transformers.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> The amounts of computation and memory required by a transformer’s self-attention mechanism rises quadratically with the size of its input, while the amounts required by linear attention scale linearly. Using linear attention instead should boost efficiency. Furthermore, self-attention layers process input images globally, while convolutions work locally on groups of adjacent pixels. So adding convolutions should enable a transformer to generate representations that emphasize nearby pixels, which are likely to be closely related. Convolutions offer additional benefits, too, such as translation equivariance (that is, they generate the same representation of a pattern regardless of its location in an image).<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> In each of three transformers, the authors added convolutions and replaced self- attention with a different variety of linear attention. One used <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14794?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9H55Ayjz_iqco2zBQY2mlfAz-ab6gqplLKURCHGQMGzJUS43ekA1fA5Zfct185eaKPo6Wo\" rel=\"noopener\">Performers</a>’ variation on linear attention, another used <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03902?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9H55Ayjz_iqco2zBQY2mlfAz-ab6gqplLKURCHGQMGzJUS43ekA1fA5Zfct185eaKPo6Wo\" rel=\"noopener\">Nyströmformer</a>’s, and the third used <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16236?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9H55Ayjz_iqco2zBQY2mlfAz-ab6gqplLKURCHGQMGzJUS43ekA1fA5Zfct185eaKPo6Wo\" rel=\"noopener\">Linear Transformer</a>’s.

They also outperformed ResNets an order of magnitude larger. For example, the CXV model (1.3 million parameters) outfitted with Performer’s linear attention achieved 91.42 percent accuracy on CIFAR-10 and required 3.2 GB of memory. A ResNet-18 (11.2 million parameters) achieved 86.29 percent, though it required only 0.6 GB of memory. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02239?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9H55Ayjz_iqco2zBQY2mlfAz-ab6gqplLKURCHGQMGzJUS43ekA1fA5Zfct185eaKPo6Wo\" rel=\"noopener\">Hybrid ViP-6/8</a> (1.3 million parameters), which also used Performer’s linear attention mechanism without convolutions, achieved 77.54 percent while using 5.9 GB of memory.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> The authors experimented with low-resolution images (32x32 in CIFAR and 64x64 in TinyImageNet). Their results may have been more dramatic had they used higher-res images.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Researchers have looked to linear attention to make vision transformers more efficient virtually since the original Vision Transformer was proposed.
