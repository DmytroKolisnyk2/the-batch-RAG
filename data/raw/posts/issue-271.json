By using AI to model its impact and thereby advance our understanding of SAI, we’ll be better prepared to decide if this is a good step.</p><p>The key idea of SAI, which is a form of climate geoengineering, is to spray reflective particles into the stratosphere to reflect a little more, say 1%, of the sunlight that otherwise would fall on Earth back into space. This small increase in reflected sunlight would be sufficient to mitigate much of the impact of human-induced warming. For example, in 1991, Mount Pinatubo ejected almost 20 tons of aerosols (sulfur dioxide) into the atmosphere and cooled down the planet by around 0.5 degrees Celsius over the following year. We should be able to induce cooling equivalent to, say, a fraction of Mount Pinatubo, via a fair, international process that’s backed by science.</p><p>There are many criticisms of SAI, such as:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>It could have unintended climate consequences, for example, disrupting&nbsp;local weather patterns and creating droughts or floods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>If it were started and then stopped suddenly, it could lead to sudden warming, known as “termination shock.”</li><li>Depending on the aerosol used (sulfur dioxide is a leading candidate), it could contribute to pollution and/or ozone depletion.&nbsp;</li><li>It might reduce urgency to decarbonize (an example of a “moral hazard”).</li></ul><p>In addition, many people have a visceral emotional reaction, as I once did before I understood the science more deeply, against “playing god” by daring to engineer the planet.</p><p>All these downsides should be balanced against the reality that people are dying.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/10/unnamed--18--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Graph showing global warming with and without aerosol injection.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"674\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/unnamed--18--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/unnamed--18--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/10/unnamed--18--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>I’m moved by meteorologist John Morales’ emotional account of the havoc caused by Hurricane Milton.&nbsp;<em>The New York Times</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVMtH_5DYbHMN2J7jhj8NN6YW430FVB5mdsGQN179mr03qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3p0W8MN-dP43JR_zW8NmR2665JzclW5cVS_D5k1FsJW6nt0qG8l8LBqW4FVxPc5TFCrcV47scv4Q1ngsW1LkGwJ213JjxW5p2-l52YGyfVVbXXCv8KNPWfW8ZCdk363VSb_W7lHkbW3SvT4RW3v5TDq5k4ZzrN6X9qPxFJg_hW2DMGRZ4g89p7W3f0-cr10cCCPW4MMxbF2KStfcN2r4DnhSmWC9W83PbrW7L8l6mF99sWqLjrFrW3795NX2WhLG7Vqyfd47-nPN8VcC2j74ksQ1WW3sv-Qw1JjQ9nN9ddVNQC2J9XW19Z0Yh1KJr_vN3y4dS8KJ32cW3LplW77m8FvCW7rCxVV71VNgmf8dJmcb04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">quoted</a>&nbsp;him as saying, “It claims lives.

Meanwhile, models built in China such as DeepSeek, Qwen, and Kling challenged the top models despite the United States’ restrictions on exports of the most powerful AI chips. The year saw a proliferation of models small enough to run on local devices, such as Gemini Nano (3.25 billion parameters) and the smaller of Apple’s AFM family (3 billion parameters).</li><li><strong>Research:</strong>&nbsp;Model builders settled on mixtures of curated natural and synthetic data for training larger models (Microsoft’s Phi family, Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Meta Llama 3.1) and knowledge distillation for training smaller ones (Flux.1, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Mistral-NeMo-Minitron, and numerous others). Meanwhile, researchers established benchmarks to measure new capabilities like video understanding and agentic problem-solving. Another motivation for new benchmarks is to replace older tests in which new models consistently achieve high scores, possibly because the test data had contaminated their training data.</li><li><strong>Finance:</strong>&nbsp;Investment boomed. The chip designer Nvidia contributed nearly one-third of the AI industry’s $9 trillion total value, including public and private companies, and the combined value of public AI companies alone exceeded the entire industry’s value last year. The most dramatic single trend in AI finance was the shift by major public companies from acquisitions to acquisition-like transactions, in which tech giants took on talent from top startups, sometimes in exchange for licensing fees, without buying them outright: notably Amazon-Covariant, Google-Character.AI, and Microsoft-Inflection. In venture investment, robotics now accounts for nearly 30 percent of all funding. Standouts included the humanoid startup Figure with a $675 million round at a $2.6 billion valuation and its competitor 1X with a $125 million round.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Regulation:</strong>&nbsp;Regulation of AI remains fragmented globally. The U.S. issued executive orders that mainly relied on new interpretations or implementations of existing laws. Europe’s AI Act sought to balance innovation and caution by declaring that large models pose a special risk and banning applications such as predictive policing, but some observers have deemed it heavy-handed. China focused on enforcement of its more restrictive laws, requiring companies to submit models for government review. Widespread fears that AI would disrupt 2024’s many democratic elections proved unfounded.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Safety:</strong>&nbsp;While anxieties in 2023 focused on abstract threats such as the risk that AI would take over the world, practical concerns came to the fore. Model makers worked to increase transparency, interpretability, and security against external attacks. Actual security incidents occurred on a more personal scale: Bad actors used widely available tools to harass and impersonate private citizens, notably generating fake pornographic images of them, which remains an unsolved problem.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Looking forward:</strong>&nbsp;The authors reviewed predictions they made in last year’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVMtH_5DYbHMN2J7jhj8NN6YW430FVB5mdsGQN179mq63qgyTW6N1vHY6lZ3mhW13phN05kDf4NW79Swk28_2MftW7YXwgd8GsyBDW8CGcw167pl1jW89C70-1qd4KGW7bwzHK8r9P_DW6SldkD47t8ryW6KdJ0h1JPPm-MRN0Y07z781W2h_yMm9jWjP-W835fxq91hFbVW6bCFwm2x-z8jW7JVQqW4n_ycDVfjdwB6S524NVDwM-y25-b9tVn7Jtz1NV2zqW2BXYFn42h8MJW7Pqdck68JWTrVDx_pv1SXSddW9ddjYn2Qlf-ZW2glKKV930JC4VRYLXK87Jbphf4hwXP804?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a>&nbsp;— among them, regulators would investigate the Microsoft/OpenAI Partnership (accurate), and a model builder would spend over $1 billion on training (not yet) — and forecast key developments in 2025:</p><ul><li>An open source model will outperform OpenAI’s proprietary o1 on reasoning benchmarks.</li><li>European lawmakers, fearing that the AI Act overreaches, will refrain from strict enforcement.</li><li>Generative AI will hit big.

Medium sizes reduced performance only slightly. For instance, using all 1,024 values for retrieval, the model achieved 63.35 percent normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG), a measure of how well the model ranks the retrieved documents (higher is better). When it used the first 32 values, the model achieved 52.54 percent nDCG; and when it used 128 values, it achieved 61.64 percent nDCG.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:&nbsp;</strong>Training a set of LoRA adapters is becoming the go-to method for adapting a pretrained model for a variety of tasks. Jina extends the list to computing embeddings for different language tasks and gives developers a further option for generating high-quality embeddings.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;The authors’ results show that using embeddings that are one-eighth the typical size degrades performance by only 2 percent. That tradeoff may be worthwhile if your computational budget is constrained or your task is especially data-intensive.</p>","comment_id":"6710367713d19b000156993d","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/10/Disen-o-sin-ti-tulo.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2024-10-16T14:56:07.000-07:00","updated_at":"2024-10-18T11:44:49.000-07:00","published_at":"2024-10-16T15:09:00.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"The
