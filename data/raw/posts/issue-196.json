Sometimes, I've spent all day on a weekend developing ideas only to find that I've spent less than $0.50.</em></p><p><em>Given the low cost of keeping me busy all day, It might not surprise you to find that the cost of scaling up a business based on a large language model (LLM) can be quite inexpensive. As a back-of-the-envelope calculation, let’s say:</em></p><ul><li><em>It costs $0.002 per 1,000 tokens, the current <a href=\"https://openai.com/pricing?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--uew4RllUQm8-AKK3zB_2_ADQUZN0iPQNHNeT0tk6JhY9aI6kIp6yHXukqD6FHblRSQVhW\" rel=\"noopener\">price</a> of OpenAI's popular gpt-3.5-turbo conversational model. Pricing can be up to 5x lower or 30x higher depending on the model's quality, but this one is popular among developers, so let's go with it.</em></li><li><em>A token corresponds to 0.75 words.</em></li><li><em>A user can read 250 words per minute.</em></li><li><em>Length of prompts and generated responses is roughly the same.</em></li></ul><p><em>Then it costs around $0.08 to generate enough text to keep someone busy for an hour.</em></p><p><em>Here are some ways to think about this when it comes to automating or assisting a person’s work task:</em></p><ul><li><em>For most tasks that we might hire someone to do, the cost is significantly more than $0.08 per hour. For example, minimum wage in some places in the US is $15 per hour, and Amazon Mechanical Turk workers might work for around $5 per hour. So the cost of using an LLM to automate of most human tasks is very inexpensive.</em></li><li><em>If you’re generating text for a person to read, the cost of the time spent reading is significantly greater than the cost of generating the text.</em></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/05/ezgif.com-optimize--16--1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/ezgif.com-optimize--16--1.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/05/ezgif.com-optimize--16--1.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/05/ezgif.com-optimize--16--1.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>On the flip side:</em></p><ul><li><em>Up to an order of magnitude, social media companies might make around $0.10 per hour that a user spends on their sites. So if we’re generating personalized text for one person, the financial case is iffy. (I don’t think this is necessarily a bad thing. Society doesn’t need people to spend even more time on social media!)</em></li><li><em>On the other hand, if we’re generating content to be read by a large audience, such as a news article, then the cost is amortized across the audience, and it is quite inexpensive again.</em></li></ul><p><em>Please don’t use my back-of-the-envelope calculation for any significant business decisions, and do carry out your own calculations with careful assumptions specific to your project. But if you haven’t stepped through such a calculation before, the takeaway is that LLMs are actually quite inexpensive to use.</em></p><p><em>Granted, some models (like one version of GPT-4, at 15-30x the cost used in the calculation, leading to a cost of $1.80 instead of $0.08) are much more expensive. If your application requires a more capable model, then the calculation does change. But I’m optimistic that prices will come down over time, and these are all wonderful tools to have in your toolbox.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p><em>P.S.

When search was young, search engines that covered the web (like Google) competed with vertical search engines that covered niches such as retail (Amazon) or travel (Expedia). A similar competition is shaping up between general-purpose chatbots and vertical chatbots.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/05/unnamed--63-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/05/unnamed--63-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"don%E2%80%99t-steal-my-style\">Don’t Steal My Style</h1><p>Asked to produce “a landscape by Thomas Kinkade,” a text-to-image generator fine-tuned on the pastoral painter’s work can mimic his style in seconds, often for pennies. A new technique aims to make it harder for algorithms to mimic an artist’s style.</p><p><strong>What’s new: </strong>Shawn Shan and colleagues at University of Chicago unveiled <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04222?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--uew4RllUQm8-AKK3zB_2_ADQUZN0iPQNHNeT0tk6JhY9aI6kIp6yHXukqD6FHblRSQVhW\" rel=\"noopener\">Glaze</a>, a tool that imperceptibly alters works of art to prevent machine learning models from learning the artist's style from them. You can download it <a href=\"http://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--uew4RllUQm8-AKK3zB_2_ADQUZN0iPQNHNeT0tk6JhY9aI6kIp6yHXukqD6FHblRSQVhW\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Key insight: </strong>Art style depends on many factors (color, shape, form, space, texture, and others). Some styles tend not to blend easily. For instance, a portrait can’t show both the sharp edges of a photograph and the oil-paint strokes of Vincent Van Gogh. Trained models have encountered few, if any, such blends, so they tend not to be able to mimic them accurately. But the ability of text-to-image generators to translate images into a different style (by prompting them with words like “. . . in the style of Van Gough”) makes it possible to alter a photorealistic portrait imperceptibly to make some pixels more like an oil painting (or vice-versa). Fine-tuned on such alterations, a text-to-image generator that’s prompted to imitate them will produce an incoherent blend that differs notably from the original style.</p><p><strong>How it works: </strong>Glaze makes an artist’s images more similar to images of a very different style. The difference derails image generators while being imperceptible to the human eye.</p><ul><li>Glaze uses embeddings previously generated by Stable Diffusion. That model’s image encoder generated embeddings of works by more than 1,000 celebrated artists. Then it generated an embedding of each artist by computing the centroid of the embeddings of the artist’s works.</li><li>Given works by a new artist, Glaze uses Stable Diffusion to generate an artist embedding in the same way.</li><li>Glaze compares the new artist’s embedding with those of other artists using an undescribed method. It chooses an artist whose embedding is between the most distant 50 percent to 75 percent.</li><li>Glaze uses Stable Diffusion to translate each of the new artist’s works into the chosen artist’s style.</li><li>For each of the new artist’s works, Glaze <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_method?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--uew4RllUQm8-AKK3zB_2_ADQUZN0iPQNHNeT0tk6JhY9aI6kIp6yHXukqD6FHblRSQVhW\" rel=\"noopener\">learns</a> a small perturbation (a learned vector) and uses it to modify the pixels in the original work. In doing so, it minimizes the difference between the embeddings of the perturbed work and style-transferred version. To avoid changing the work too much, it keeps the vector’s magnitude (that is, the perturbation’s cumulative effect) below a certain threshold.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors fine-tuned Stable Diffusion on Glaze-modified works by 13 artists of various styles and historical periods. Roughly 1,100 artists evaluated groups of four original and four mimicked works and rated how well Glaze protected an artist’s style (that is, how poorly Stable Diffusion mimicked the artist). 93.3 percent of evaluators found that Glaze successfully protected the style, while 4.6 percent judged that a separate Stable Diffusion fine-tuned on unmodified art was protective.</p><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> It’s an open question whether Glaze works regardless of the combination of models used to produce embeddings, perform style transfer, and generate images. The authors’ tests were limited in this regard.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>As AI extends its reach into the arts, copyright law doesn’t yet address the use of creative works to train AI systems. Glaze enables artists to have a greater say in how their works can be used — by Stable Diffusion, at least.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> While technology can give artists some measure of protection against stylistic appropriation by AI models, ultimately society at large must resolve questions about what is and isn't fair. Thoughtful regulation would be better than a cat-and-mouse game between artists and developers.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong>Wendy's is testing an AI-powered chatbot for drive-thru orders</strong><br>The tool will leverage Google's natural-language models in a pilot program set to launch in June at a Wendy's location in Ohio.
