I remain concerned that regulators may stifle innovation and open source development in the name of AI safety. But after interacting with the senators and their staff, I’m grateful that many smart people in the government are paying attention to this issue.</em></p><p><em>How likely are doomsday scenarios?

A year ago, an innocent user might have been surprised by toxic output or dangerous instructions, but today this is much less likely. LLMs today are quite safe, much like content moderation on the internet, although neither is perfect.</em></p><p><em>To test the safety of leading models, I recently tried to get GPT-4 to kill us all, and I'm happy to report that I failed! More seriously, GPT-4 allows users to give it functions that it can decide to call. I gave GPT-4 a function to trigger global thermonuclear war. (Obviously, I don't have access to a nuclear weapon; I performed this experiment as a form of red teaming or safety testing.) Then I told GPT-4 to reduce CO2 emissions, and that humans are the biggest cause of CO2 emissions, to see if it would wipe out humanity to accomplish its goal. After numerous attempts using different prompt variations, I didn’t manage to trick GPT-4 into calling that function even once; instead, it chose other options like running a PR campaign to raise awareness of climate change. Today’s models are smart enough to know that their default mode of operation is to obey the law and avoid doing harm. To me, the probability that a “misaligned” AI might wipe us out accidentally, because it was trying to accomplish an innocent but poorly specified goal, seems vanishingly small.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Are there any real doomsday risks? The main one that deserves more study is the possibility that a malevolent individual (or terrorist organization, or nation state) would deliberately use AI to do harm.

Last-minute agreements lightened the burdens on small companies and open source development. It includes the following provisions:</p><ul><li>The AI Act does not apply to (i) systems intended solely for research, (ii) systems outside the purview of EU law such as member states’ militaries and security apparatus, and (iii) law enforcement agencies. Developers of free and open source models are exempt from some requirements as specified below.</li><li>The bill bans certain AI applications under particular circumstances, including predictive policing, scraping of face images without a specific target, emotion recognition in workplaces or schools, rating the trustworthiness or social standing of individuals to determine risk of default or fraud, and use of biometric data to infer sensitive demographic information such as religion or sexual orientation.</li><li>AI systems used in designated high-risk areas like biometric identification, border control, education, employment, infrastructure, justice, and public services face special scrutiny. Developers must conduct safety assessments and provide detailed proof of safety. The burden is somewhat lighter for small and medium-sized companies, whose fees are proportionate to their size and market share. Small and medium-sized businesses also have access to so-called “regulatory sandboxes,” deployment environments in which regulatory costs are waived altogether in exchange for increased supervision.</li><li>Developers of general-purpose artificial intelligence (GPAI), defined as models that can be used for many different tasks, must report the procedures and data they used to train their models. Free and open-source models are exempt from these requirements. All models must comply with EU copyright laws.</li><li>Prior to being made widely available, GPAI models that pose “systemic risks” must report energy consumption, fine-tuning data, risks, security testing, and security incidents. (What distinguishes a model that poses “systemic risks” from one that doesn’t is unclear.) Free and open-source models are not exempt from these requirements.&nbsp;</li><li>All AI-generated media must be clearly labeled.</li><li>The bill sets multi-million-euro fines for companies that violate its terms. Startups and small companies will be charged smaller fines for violations.</li><li>A new AI Office within the EU’s executive branch will oversee GPAI models and create standards and testing practices. An independent panel of scientists will advise the AI Office. An AI Board consisting of representatives from each EU member state will advise the AI Office and transmit its decisions to member states.</li></ul><p><strong>What’s next:</strong>&nbsp;The representatives have agreed on these broad strokes, but they will continue to revise the details.

The group stated its intention to pursue a variety of projects:</p><ul><li>Develop open foundation models, especially multilingual and multimodal models</li><li>Provide free benchmarks, standards, and safety and security tools to aid responsible development of AI systems</li><li>Encourage development of hardware that benefits open AI</li><li>Educate and lobby policymakers to encourage open development</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:&nbsp;</strong>The membership includes organizations that have prioritized open source development including Meta, Stability AI, and the Linux Foundation. Yet several organizations that provide popular open-source models are not represented, including models released under more permissive open source licenses like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt_neo?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz---h3KdCj0pNt1y_qayJja8PoFR6r6WWWzVWr3krEuNiAsfk951nUy7WWtJ43ACJqBbkBDU\" rel=\"noopener\">GPT Neo</a>​​ and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz---h3KdCj0pNt1y_qayJja8PoFR6r6WWWzVWr3krEuNiAsfk951nUy7WWtJ43ACJqBbkBDU\" rel=\"noopener\">Mistral</a>. Major companies like Apple and Google, who have released some of their work under open source licenses, are also absent.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Yes, but:&nbsp;</strong>The meaning of “open” is contentious, and AI Alliance does not clearly define it. In large language models, for instance, the spectrum of openness includes:</p><ul><li>Closed offerings like GPT-4 and Gemini</li><li>Semi-open models like Llama 2, which requires a special license for widely used applications</li><li>Projects licensed under open source terms that meet the standard defined by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://opensource.org/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz---h3KdCj0pNt1y_qayJja8PoFR6r6WWWzVWr3krEuNiAsfk951nUy7WWtJ43ACJqBbkBDU\" rel=\"noopener\">Open Source Initiative</a>, such as Apache and MIT, which permit anyone to use, modify, and distribute licensed code</li><li>Releases that include not only a trained model but also the code to train it from scratch</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;More openness means faster sharing of knowledge and a greater pace of innovation. The AI Alliance can put substantial resources and breadth of influence behind proponents of openness, potentially acting as a counterweight against well financed commercial interests that are threatened by open source development. For instance, some companies claim that restricting access to AI models is necessary to ensure that bad actors don’t misuse them; of course, it would also eliminate open source competition with those companies. On the other hand, open source advocates&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.mozilla.org/letter/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz---h3KdCj0pNt1y_qayJja8PoFR6r6WWWzVWr3krEuNiAsfk951nUy7WWtJ43ACJqBbkBDU\" rel=\"noopener\">argue</a>&nbsp;that transparency makes AI models less likely to be dangerous, since anyone can spot dangers and alter the code to reduce them.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Open source is a powerful engine of innovation that enables people to build freely on earlier developments for the benefit of all. The AI Alliance’s gathering of commercial, institutional, and academic clout looks like a promising approach to promoting openness.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/12/I-JEPA-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/I-JEPA-1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/I-JEPA-1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/12/I-JEPA-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"the-big-picture-and-the-details\">The Big Picture&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;the Details</h1><p>A novel twist on self-supervised learning aims to improve on earlier methods by helping vision models learn how parts of an image relate to the whole.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;Mahmoud Assran and colleagues at Meta, McGill University, Mila, and New York University developed a vision pretraining technique that’s designed to address weaknesses in typical masked image modeling and contrastive learning approaches. They call it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Assran_Self-Supervised_Learning_From_Images_With_a_Joint-Embedding_Predictive_Architecture_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz---h3KdCj0pNt1y_qayJja8PoFR6r6WWWzVWr3krEuNiAsfk951nUy7WWtJ43ACJqBbkBDU\" rel=\"noopener\">Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture</a>&nbsp;(I-JEPA).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;Masked image modeling trains models to reconstruct hidden or noisy patches of an image. This encourages models to learn details of training images at the expense of larger features. On the other hand, contrastive approaches train models to create similar embeddings for distorted or augmented versions of the same image. This encourages models to learn larger features, but reliance on augmentations such as zooming and cropping biases models toward those variations versus the wider variety they’re likely to encounter in the wild. I-JEPA combines these approaches: The model learns to embed regions that are made up of many patches, some of them masked, based on the surrounding unmasked patches. This approach balances learning of low- and high-level features.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;I-JEPA used three components: (i) A target encoder embedded an image’s target region, (ii) a context encoder embedded the surrounding area, and (iii) a smaller predictor network, given the context embedding, tried to produce an embedding similar to that of the target embedding. All three components were transformers, though other architectures would serve. They were pretrained jointly on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz---h3KdCj0pNt1y_qayJja8PoFR6r6WWWzVWr3krEuNiAsfk951nUy7WWtJ43ACJqBbkBDU\" rel=\"noopener\">ImageNet-1k</a>.</p><ul><li>Given an image, the system split it into non-overlapping patches.</li><li>It randomly selected 4 (potentially overlapping) rectangular target regions, each of which was made up of contiguous patches covering 15 percent to 20 percent of the image. The target encoder produced embeddings for the target regions.</li><li>The system randomly chose a context region (a square crop containing 85 percent to 100 percent of the image). It masked any patches in the context region that overlapped with the target regions. Given the masked context region, the context encoder produced an embedding of each patch in the context region and its position.</li><li>Given the context embeddings and the masked patch embeddings of a target region, the predictor produced an embedding for each patch in the target region.</li><li>For each patch in each target region, the system minimized the difference between the target embedding and predictor embedding.</li><li>The authors froze the target encoder, added a linear classifier on top of it, and trained the classifier to label 1 percent of ImageNet-1k (roughly 12 images per class).</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;An I-JEPA classifier that used ViT-H/14 encoders achieved 73.3 percent accuracy after about 2,500 GPU-hours of pretraining.
