It determined the sequence of moves using a pre-existing formula known as <a href=\"http://kociemba.org/cube.htm?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Kociemba’s algorithm</a>.</p><ul><li>The researchers designed a simulated environment where a virtual hand could manipulate a virtual cube. The model spent the equivalent of 13,000 years learning to twist simulated cubes.</li><li>They altered the simulation’s parameters from game to game, for instance, changing the cube’s size or mass, or changing the friction between fingers and cube. This procedure, known as automatic domain randomization, eased the robot’s eventual transition from the simulation to the real world: Indeed, it was able to work the cube with two fingers tied together and while wearing a glove, though it hadn’t encountered that condition in the simulation.</li><li>Once trained, the model controlled a physical hand from <a href=\"https://www.shadowrobot.com/products/dexterous-hand/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Shadow Robot Company,</a> modified with LEDs to improve motion capture, rubber pads to improve grip, and more durable components.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers considered an attempt a failure if the hand stalled or dropped the cube. The hand had a 60 percent success rate when the cube needed 15 rotations or fewer to solve the puzzle. That rate dropped to 20 percent when the solution required 26 rotations or more.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Although OpenAI’s report focused mostly on robotic dexterity, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/erwincoumans/status/1186319315336744961?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">critics</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryMarcus/status/1186314614998351872?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">accused</a> the company of overstating its claim to have taught the robot to solve Rubik’s Cube. Kociemba’s algorithm is more than a decade old and doesn’t involve learning, they pointed out, and the cube included Bluetooth and motion sensors that tracked its segments. Moreover, despite training for virtual millennia, the robot can’t do anything more than manipulate the puzzle. <br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Robots purpose-built or -coded to unscramble a Rubik’s Cube — no learning involved — are a venerable tradition. Guinness World Records recognizes a system that did the job in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBE46R-fD6M&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">0.637 seconds</a>.

Then supervised methods can be used on top of the now-labeled data. Researchers used this technique to search electronic health records (EHRs) for information squirreled away in unstructured text.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Complications from hip replacement surgery tend to be under-reported because they’re recorded in EHRs as notes rather than check-marked in a standard list. Researchers at Stanford used weak supervision to label such notes and then extracted information related to hip implants. Their <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0168-z?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">method</a> brought to light complications that hadn’t been tracked explicitly.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Alison Callahan and collaborators divided the problem of finding references to post-surgical issues in notes into two parts: identifying the implant’s make and model, and spotting mentions of pain and complications. This made it possible to use weak supervision to label data separately for each subproblem.<br><strong>How it works:</strong> Snorkel is a framework that provides a modular way to define and combine labeling functions. The model works as follows:</p><ul><li>Domain experts construct labeling functions to find the implant maker and type, mentions of pain and the anatomy affected, and mentions of the implant close to the complication it led to. For instance, a labeling function may spot a pain-related word adjacent to a body part and mark the corresponding sentence as evidence of pain. These functions assign labels for each subproblem in every sentence.</li><li>A probabilistic model (graphical model) learns the relative accuracy of the labeling functions based on mutual overlaps and conflicts of their label assignments on the training data. These metrics are then used to combine labels from each labeling function into a single label for each subproblem in every sentence.</li><li>An LSTM with attention is trained on the newly labeled data to spot complications arising from certain implants and map pain to body parts.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers trained the system on records of about 6,000 hip-replacement patients treated between 1995 and 2014. Learning the relationships between the various labeling functions uncovered twice as many patients facing complications as majority voting on their predictions (61 percent versus 32 percent). Overall, the system made it possible to assess the likelihood that a particular implant would lead to complications.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This analysis could help doctors to match patients with appropriate implants, and help implant manufacturers design their products to minimize bad outcomes.<br><br><strong>Takeaway:</strong> This approach extracts useful information from EHRs, and it looks as though it would generalize to other text-labeling tasks.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DLS20Course20120Course20Ad.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>How can you use gradient descent to train your model?

The vehicles will be remote-controlled by soldiers in M2 Bradley transports.</li><li>In 2021, Phase Two will test the same hardware on custom-built vehicles. Half of these four-wheeled prototypes will be lightweight models (less than 10 tons) and carry machine guns and anti-tank missiles. The other half will be medium-weight (up to 12 tons) and able to carry bigger weaponry.</li><li>Heavyweight autonomous tanks weighing up to 20 tons and mounted with 120mm cannons will roll out in 2023 for Phase Three.</li><li>Coffman envisions systems that enable one human to control a dozen tanks in 2035 or later. Even then, a flesh-and-blood soldier will oversee firing.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> The U.S. Army has spent billions on robotic fighting machines that never came to fruition. In 2009, the service cancelled a previous autonomous war-fighting effort, the $20 billion <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2018/07/12/army-to-unveil-details-about-new-futures-command-in-biggest-reorganization-in-45-years/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Future Combat Systems</a> program, after six years in development. That program was nixed partly because the technology didn’t progress as quickly as expected and partly due to a shift from warfare to counterterrorism.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Robot vehicles could act as decoys, drawing fire meant for human troops. They could also infiltrate enemy lines and call in artillery strikes, gather information, screen for obstacles, and wade into areas affected by nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons.<br><br><strong>What they’re saying:</strong> “Anywhere that a soldier is at the highest risk on the battlefield, and we can replace him or her with a robot, that’s what we want to do.” — Richard Ross Coffman, Director, Next Generation Combat Vehicles, U.S. Army.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> How is the Army, which must cope with irregular terrain, intermittent explosions, and the fog of war, ahead of schedule when the automotive industry, navigating smooth surfaces and relatively orderly traffic, has fallen behind its initial projections? The military faces very different problems, some harder to navigate than urban environments, some easier. Its emphasis on remote control also could make a significant difference.</p><p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Like many people, we’re unsettled by the combination of AI and fighting machines.

The machine learning algorithm made it possible to design and produce materials without conducting the usual trial-and-error physical experiments.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Principal investigator Miguel Bessa designed a mock-up with two disks connected by flexible poles, or longerons, that fold in a spiral pattern when the dishes are pressed together.</p><ul><li>In a simulator, Bassa assembled 100,000 different materials in structures that mimicked his mock-up.</li><li>Then he used the model to classify the arrangements that fit his criteria, primarily those whose longerons coiled in spiral shapes when compressed and recovered when pressure was released.</li><li>He settled on two designs and built prototype compressible masts at microscopic and human scales.</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>The microscopic prototype — built for strength — was fully compressible and able to withstand intense pressure without buckling. For the human-scale version, it was important that it spring back into its original shape, which it did even when compressed nearly flat by a machine press.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Scientists working on metamaterials (structural arrangements of existing materials that exhibit characteristics not found in nature) alter material geometries, shapes, sizes, and orientations to produce novel properties. Typically this requires lots of trial and error. Machine learning can curate arrangements likely to have the right properties, enabling researchers to focus on the most promising candidates.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> From materials science to drug design, brute force experimentation still plays a large role in bleeding-edge science.

New work explores deep learning agents’ ability to do the same thing — an important aspect of their ability to generalize.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Psychologists call this kind of thinking systematic reasoning. Researchers at DeepMind, Stanford, and University College London <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00571?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">studied</a> this capability in deep reinforcement learning models trained to interact with an environment and complete a task.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Felix Hill and colleagues trained a model to <em>put object 1 on location 1</em> with an example of that action being performed. At test time, they asked the model to <em>put object 2 on location</em> 2. Object 2 and location 2 weren’t in the training set, so the model’s ability to execute the task would indicate a generalized understanding of putting.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The model receives a view of the environment along with a task description (an instruction to put or find a given object). The model processes these elements separately, then combines its understanding of each to determine a series of actions to complete the task.</p><ul><li>The model comprises three components (the usual choices for image processing, text understanding, and sequence decisions): A CNN processes the environment view, an LSTM interprets the task description, and the CNN and LSTM outputs merge in a hidden LSTM layer to track progress toward completing the task.</li><li>The model learns to associate various objects with their names by executing put [object] or find [object] tasks.</li><li>The researchers separate objects into test and training sets. Then they train the model to put or lift objects in the training set.</li><li>To measure systematic reasoning, they ask it to lift or put objects in the test set.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers trained copies of the model in simulated 2D and 3D environments. It was over 91 percent successful in lifting novel objects either way. However, success at putting novel objects dropped to about 50 percent in both environments.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Removing the task description and LSTM component didn’t degrade performance much. That is, while words such as <em>put</em> and <em>find</em> may help humans understand how neural networks operate systematically, language apparently isn’t critical to their performance.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Neural networks are able to generalize, but our understanding of how they do it is incomplete. This research offers a way to evaluate the role of systematic reasoning. The results imply that models that reason systematically are more likely to generalize.<br><br><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The recent run of pretrained language models acquire <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01066?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">knowledge</a> that enables them to perform a variety of tasks without retraining from scratch.
