It’s always nice to know more math! But there’s so much to learn that, realistically, it’s necessary to prioritize. Here are some thoughts about how you might go about strengthening your math background.</em><br><br><em>To figure out what’s important to know, I find it useful to ask what you need to know to make the decisions required for the work you want to do. At DeepLearning.AI, we frequently ask, “What does someone need to know to accomplish their goals?” The goal might be building a machine learning model, architecting a system, or passing a job interview.</em><br><br><em>Understanding the math behind algorithms you use is often helpful, since it enables you to debug them. But the depth of knowledge that’s useful changes over time. As machine learning techniques mature and become more reliable and turnkey, they require less debugging, and a shallower understanding of the math involved may be sufficient to make them work.</em></p><p><em>For instance, in an earlier era of machine learning, linear algebra libraries for solving linear systems of equations (for linear regression) were immature. I had to understand how these libraries worked so I could choose among different libraries and avoid numerical roundoff pitfalls. But this became less important as numerical linear algebra libraries matured.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-7.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Math equations\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-7.webp 600w\"></figure><p><em>Deep learning is still an emerging technology, so when you train a neural network and the optimization algorithm struggles to converge, understanding the math behind <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/lecture/neural-networks-deep-learning/gradient-descent-A0tBd?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">gradient descent</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/lecture/deep-neural-network/gradient-descent-with-momentum-y0m1f?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">momentum</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/lecture/deep-neural-network/adam-optimization-algorithm-w9VCZ?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Adam</a> optimization algorithm will help you make better decisions. Similarly, if your neural network does something funny — say, it makes bad predictions on images of a certain resolution, but not others — understanding the math behind neural network architectures puts you in a better position to figure out what to do.</em><br><br><em>Sometimes, we’re told that an idea is “foundational.” While there’s a lot to be said for understanding foundations, often this designation is arbitrary and thus not very useful for prioritizing what to study next. For example, computing happens on processors that are packed with transistors. Do you need a deep understanding of how transistors work to write software? It's hard to imagine an AI application where a detailed knowledge of the physics of transistors would affect your decisions.</em><br><br><em>Rather than accepting an authority’s decree that a topic is foundational, it’s worth asking what circumstances would require specific knowledge to help you make better decisions.</em><br><br><em>Of course, I also encourage learning driven by curiosity. If something interests you, go ahead and learn it regardless of how useful it will be in the foreseeable future. Maybe this will lead to a creative spark or technical breakthrough.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em><br><br><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h2 id=\"news\">News</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/race.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Different x-rays and CT scans displayed \" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/race.gif 600w\"></figure><h2 id=\"ai-sees-race-in-x-rays\">AI Sees Race in X-Rays</h2><p>Algorithms trained to diagnose medical images can recognize the patient’s race — but how?<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers from Emory University, MIT, Purdue University, and other institutions <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10356?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_akBKN9cSZeuraaDkUalPTrznWRNCSkP9y54eHK8yJJS23lFyeigL2vbqFefHSPGl6bTbJJrqK8AO-6fogn-MmTm2y3A\" rel=\"noopener\">found</a> that deep learning systems trained to interpret x-rays and CT scans also were able to identify their subjects as Asian, Black, or White.<br><br><strong>What they found:</strong> Researchers trained various implementations of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_akBKN9cSZeuraaDkUalPTrznWRNCSkP9y54eHK8yJJS23lFyeigL2vbqFefHSPGl6bTbJJrqK8AO-6fogn-MmTm2y3A\" rel=\"noopener\">ResNet</a>, <a href=\"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Huang_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_akBKN9cSZeuraaDkUalPTrznWRNCSkP9y54eHK8yJJS23lFyeigL2vbqFefHSPGl6bTbJJrqK8AO-6fogn-MmTm2y3A\" rel=\"noopener\">DenseNet</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_akBKN9cSZeuraaDkUalPTrznWRNCSkP9y54eHK8yJJS23lFyeigL2vbqFefHSPGl6bTbJJrqK8AO-6fogn-MmTm2y3A\" rel=\"noopener\">EfficientNet</a> on nine medical imaging datasets in which examples were labeled Asian, Black, or White as reported by the patient.

Given the first token, it predicted the next. Then, using the first two tokens, it predicted the next, and so on.</p><ul><li>To each attention layer, the authors added a vanilla neural network that predicted the number of times that attention should use each token. It assigned a value to each new token, subtracted 1 after each prediction, and deleted the token when the value reached 0.</li><li>The loss function minimized the number of times the model used each token to keep it from assigning arbitrarily high values (otherwise, it could predict that every token should be used until the whole sequence had been processed). In this way, the model learned to retain only the tokens most useful to an accurate prediction.</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>The authors evaluated Expire-Span based on total memory usage, training time per batch, and bits per byte (a measure of how well the model predicted the next token; lower is better).

Earlier, the U.S. had said it would spend <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-wants-to-double-spending-on-ai-quantum-computing-11581378069?mod=article_inline&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_akBKN9cSZeuraaDkUalPTrznWRNCSkP9y54eHK8yJJS23lFyeigL2vbqFefHSPGl6bTbJJrqK8AO-6fogn-MmTm2y3A\" rel=\"noopener\">$2 billion annually</a> on AI over the next two years.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Other governments spend much more on AI than the U.S., and this outlay is small in the scheme of national AI funding. However, the allocation and the goals to which it is being put suggest that the federal government recognizes AI’s importance to the U.S. economy and its potential to benefit the world at large.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>U.S. government funding was critical to AI's rise. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Products Agency (DARPA) provided <a href=\"https://www.federalgrants.com/Deep-Learning-DL-18210.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_akBKN9cSZeuraaDkUalPTrznWRNCSkP9y54eHK8yJJS23lFyeigL2vbqFefHSPGl6bTbJJrqK8AO-6fogn-MmTm2y3A\" rel=\"noopener\">funds</a> to both Andrew and Yann LeCun for deep learning research.
