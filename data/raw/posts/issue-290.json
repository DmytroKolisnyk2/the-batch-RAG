Systems that interact with users via speaking and listening will drive many new applications. Over the past year, I’ve been working closely with DeepLearning.AI, AI Fund, and several collaborators on voice-based applications, and I will share best practices I’ve learned in this and future letters.</p><p>Foundation models that are trained to directly input, and often also directly generate, audio have contributed to this growth, but they are only part of the story. OpenAI’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_BuF-Wf7X_-nOlH7XesNh989iswtt1SPiiS17N_Kwf37hMN3VM9Ju-Ha9-PlOvw2-HoNBd\" rel=\"noopener\">RealTime API</a>&nbsp;makes it easy for developers to write prompts to develop systems that deliver voice-in, voice-out experiences. This is great for building quick-and-dirty prototypes, and it also works well for low-stakes conversations where making an occasional mistake is okay. I encourage you to try it!</p><p>However, compared to text-based generation, it is still hard to control the output of voice-in voice-out models. In contrast to directly generating audio, when we use an LLM to generate text, we have many tools for building guardrails, and we can double-check the output before showing it to users. We can also use sophisticated agentic reasoning workflows to compute high-quality outputs. Before a customer-service agent shows a user the message, “Sure, I’m happy to issue a refund,” we can make sure that (i) issuing the refund is consistent with our business policy and (ii) we will call the API to issue the refund (and not just promise a refund without issuing it).</p><p>In contrast, the tools to prevent a voice-in, voice-out model from making such mistakes are much less mature.</p><p>In my experience, the reasoning capability of voice models also seems inferior to text-based models, and they give less sophisticated answers. (Perhaps this is because voice responses have to be more brief, leaving less room for chain-of-thought reasoning to get to a more thoughtful answer.)</p><p>When building applications where I need a high degree of control over the output, I use agentic workflows to reason at length about the user’s input. In voice applications, this means I end up using a pipeline that includes speech-to-text (STT, also known as ASR, or automatic speech recognition) to transcribe the user’s words, then processes the text using one or more LLM calls, and finally returns an audio response to the user via TTS (text-to-speech). This STT → LLM/Agentic workflow → TTS pipeline, where the reasoning is done in text, allows for more accurate responses.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/unnamed--52-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Diagram comparing direct audio generation with a foundation model vs. a voice pipeline using STT, LLM, and TTS.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/unnamed--52-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/unnamed--52-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/unnamed--52-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>However, this process introduces latency, and users of voice applications are very sensitive to latency. When DeepLearning.AI worked with RealAvatar (an AI Fund portfolio company led by Jeff Daniel) to build an avatar of me, we found that getting TTS to generate a voice that sounded like me was not very hard, but getting it to respond to questions using words similar to those I would choose was. Even after a year of tuning our system — starting with iterating on multiple, long, mega-prompts and eventually developing complex agentic workflows — it remains a work in progress. You can play with it&nbsp;<a href=\"http://deeplearning.ai/avatar?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_BuF-Wf7X_-nOlH7XesNh989iswtt1SPiiS17N_Kwf37hMN3VM9Ju-Ha9-PlOvw2-HoNBd\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p><p>Initially, this agentic workflow incurred 5-9 seconds of latency, and having users wait that long for responses led to a bad experience. To address this, we came up with the following latency reduction technique. The system quickly generates a pre-response (short for preliminary response) that can be uttered quickly, which buys time for an agentic workflow to generate a more thoughtful, full response. (We’re grateful to LiveKit’s CEO Russ d’Sa and team for helping us get this working.) This is similar to how, if you were to ask me a complicated question, I might say “Hmm, let me think about that” or “Sure, I can help with that” — that’s the pre-response — while thinking about what my full response might be.</p><p>I think generating a pre-response followed by a full response, to quickly acknowledge the user’s query and also reduce the perceived latency, will be an important technique, and I hope many teams will find this useful. Our goal was to approach human face-to-face conversational latency, which is around 0.3-1 seconds. RealAvatar and DeepLearning.AI, through our efforts on the pre-response and other optimizations, have reduced the system’s latency to around 0.5-1 seconds.</p><p>Months ago, sitting in a coffee shop, I was able to buy a phone number on Twilio and hook it up to an STT → LLM → TTS pipeline in just hours. This enabled me to talk to my own LLM using custom prompts. Prototyping voice applications is much easier than most people realize!</p><p>Building reliable, scaled production applications takes longer, of course, but if you have a voice application in mind, I hope you’ll start building prototypes and see how far you can get! I’ll keep building voice applications and sharing best practices and voice-related technology trends in future letters.</p><p>Keep building!</p><p>Andrew</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/build-apps-with-windsurfs-ai-coding-agents/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-02-25T173657.996--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Promo banner for: &quot;Build Apps with Windsurf’s AI Coding Agents&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1890\" height=\"1063\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-02-25T173657.996--1-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-02-25T173657.996--1-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-02-25T173657.996--1-.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-02-25T173657.996--1-.png 1890w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>AI coding agents do more than autocomplete.

If the creators of the video that appropriated the images of celebrities had responded to Johansson’s criticism with an AI-generated satire, would that be a legitimate exercise of free speech or another misuse of AI? Previously, an ambiguous legal framework may have been acceptable because such images, and thus lawsuits arising from them, were uncommon. Now, as synthetic likenesses of specific people become easier to generate, clear legal boundaries are needed to keep misuses in check.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Creating unauthorized lookalikes of existing people is not a good way to advance any cause, however worthy. Developers should work with businesses policymakers to establish standards that differentiate legitimate uses from unfair or misleading exploitation.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/unnamed--51-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Diagram of Coconut, a method that trains LLMs to process thought chains as vectors instead of words.

Researchers addressed this inefficiency.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;Shibo Hao, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, and colleagues at Meta and University of California San Diego introduced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_BuF-Wf7X_-nOlH7XesNh989iswtt1SPiiS17N_Kwf37hMN3VM9Ju-Ha9-PlOvw2-HoNBd\" rel=\"noopener\">Coconut</a>&nbsp;(Chain of Continuous Thought), a method that trains large language models (LLMs) to process chains of thought as vectors rather than words.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;A large language model (LLM) can be broken into an embedding layer, transformer, and classification layer. To generate the next text token from input text, the embedding layer embeds the text; given the text, the transformer outputs a hidden vector; and the classification layer maps the vector to text-token probabilities. Based on these probabilities, a decoding algorithm selects the next token to generate, which feeds back into the input text sequence to generate the next vector, and so on. When a model generates a CoT, committing to a specific word at each step limits the information available to the meanings of the words generated so far, while a vector could represent multiple possible words. Using vectors instead of text enables the CoT to encode richer information.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors built three LLMs by fine-tuning a pre-trained&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_BuF-Wf7X_-nOlH7XesNh989iswtt1SPiiS17N_Kwf37hMN3VM9Ju-Ha9-PlOvw2-HoNBd\" rel=\"noopener\">GPT-2</a>&nbsp;on three datasets of prompts, CoTs, and final outputs:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14168?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_BuF-Wf7X_-nOlH7XesNh989iswtt1SPiiS17N_Kwf37hMN3VM9Ju-Ha9-PlOvw2-HoNBd\" rel=\"noopener\">GSM8k</a>&nbsp;(grade-school math word problems);&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01240?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_BuF-Wf7X_-nOlH7XesNh989iswtt1SPiiS17N_Kwf37hMN3VM9Ju-Ha9-PlOvw2-HoNBd\" rel=\"noopener\">ProntoQA</a>&nbsp;(questions and answers about fictional concepts expressed in made-up words, including synthetic CoTs in natural language); and (3) ProsQA, a more challenging question-answering dataset introduced by the authors, inspired by ProntoQA but with longer reasoning steps.</p><ul><li>Fine-tuning began with supervised training. The LLM learned to generate the text in the training set, including the CoT and final answers. As usual, the last-generated text token was fed back as input to produce the next token.</li><li>Fine-tuning then progressed through k stages for each example. At each stage, the authors replaced a sentence in the CoT text with a thought vector (or two) to build a sequence of k replaced sentences. The start and end of the chain of thought vectors were marked by two special tokens. During vector steps, the LLM fed its output vectors back as input without decoding them into text. The LLM learned to generate only the remaining text tokens, not the thought vectors, which encouraged it to optimize its vector-based reasoning indirectly.</li><li>During inference, the LLM generated a special token to mark the start of the chain of vectors. From this point, it fed back its output vectors, bypassing text decoding for six steps. Afterward, the LLM switched back to generating text for final output.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors compared their method to a pretrained GPT-2 that was fine-tuned on the same datasets to predict the next word, including reasoning.</p><ul><li>On ProntoQA, Coconut outperformed the fine-tuned GPT-2 while producing far fewer interim vectors (Coconut) or tokens (baseline LLMs). It achieved 99.8 percent accuracy after generating nine vectors (or tokens) on average, while GPT-2 achieved 98.8 percent accuracy using 92.5 text tokens.</li><li>Coconut excelled on ProsQA’s more complex questions. It achieved 97.0 percent accuracy after generating 14.2 vectors (or tokens) on average, while GPT-2 achieved 77.5 percent accuracy after generating 49.4 text tokens on average.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong>&nbsp;On GSM8k, Coconut achieved 34.1 percent accuracy, while the baseline LLM achieved 42.9 percent. However, it generated significantly fewer vectors and tokens than the CoT generated tokens. Coconut generated 8.2 vectors on average compared to the baseline LLM’s 25 text tokens.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;A traditional CoT commits to a single word at each step and thus encodes one reasoning path in a single CoT. Vectors are less interpretable to humans than language, but the model’s output layer can still decode the thought vectors into probabilities over tokens. Further, inspecting the distribution of words stored along all continuous CoT vectors offers a way to understand multiple potential thought paths stored in one continuous CoT.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;LLMs typically learn to reason over text, mainly because text data is widely available to train on. In contrast, neuroscience shows that the part of the human brain responsible for language largely&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30611876/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_BuF-Wf7X_-nOlH7XesNh989iswtt1SPiiS17N_Kwf37hMN3VM9Ju-Ha9-PlOvw2-HoNBd\" rel=\"noopener\">goes quiet</a>&nbsp;during reasoning tasks, which suggests that explicit language is not a key mechanism for reasoning. Coconut takes an intriguing step to enable LLMs to explore representations that don’t encode the limitations of language.</p>","comment_id":"67bf7b4ac12d39000139571b","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/Untitled-design--18-.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2025-02-26T12:36:26.000-08:00","updated_at":"2025-03-20T23:37:28.000-07:00","published_at":"2025-02-26T12:47:00.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"The Batch AI News and Insights: The Voice Stack is improving rapidly.
