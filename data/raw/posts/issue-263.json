This is important because the technology is general-purpose and its builders (such as a developer who releases an open-weights foundation model) cannot control how someone else might use it. If, however, someone applies AI in a nefarious way, we should stop that application.&nbsp;</p><p>Even before generative AI, fake reviews were a problem on many websites, and many tech companies dedicate considerable resources to combating them. A telltale sign of old-school fake reviews is the use of similar wording in different reviews. AI’s ability to automatically paraphrase or rewrite is making fake reviews harder to detect.</p><p>Importantly, the FTC is not going after the makers of foundation models for fake reviews. The provider of an open weights AI model, after all, can’t control what someone else uses it for. Even if one were to try to train a model to put up guardrails against writing reviews, I don’t know how it could distinguish between a real user of a product asking for help writing a legitimate review and a spammer who wanted a fake review. The FTC appropriately aims to ban the application of fake reviews along with other deceptive practices such as buying positive reviews.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/08/unnamed--80--1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/unnamed--80--1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/unnamed--80--1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/08/unnamed--80--1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>The DEFIANCE Act, which passed unanimously in the Senate (and still requires passage in the House of Representatives before the President can sign it into law) imposes civil penalties for the creating and distributing non-consensual, deepfake porn.
