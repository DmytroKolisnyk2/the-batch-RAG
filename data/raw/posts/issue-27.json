Deep learning researchers are working on it.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Stanford researcher Christopher Metzler and colleagues at Princeton, Southern Methodist University, and Rice University developed <a href=\"https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-7-1-63&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">deep-inverse correlography</a>, a technique that interprets reflected light to reveal objects outside the line of sight. The technique can capture submillimeter details from one meter away, making it possible to, say, read a <a href=\"https://news.rice.edu/2020/01/21/cameras-see-around-corners-in-real-time-with-deep-learning/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">license plate</a> around a corner.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Light bouncing off objects retains information about their shape even as it ricochets off walls. The researchers modeled the distortions likely to occur under such conditions and generated a dataset accordingly, enabling them to train a neural network to extract images of objects from their diminished, diffuse, noisy reflections.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The experimental setup included an off-the-shelf laser and camera, a rough wall (called a virtual detector), and a U-Net convolutional neural network trained to reconstruct an image from its reflections.</p><ul><li>To train the U-Net, the researchers generated over 1 million images in pairs, one a simple curve (the team deemed natural images infeasible), the other a simulation of the corresponding reflections.</li><li>The researchers shined the laser at a wall. Bouncing off the wall, the light struck an object around the corner. The light caromed off the object, back to the wall, and into the camera.</li><li>The U-Net accepted the camera’s output and disentangled interference patterns in the light waves to reconstruct an image.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers tested the system by spying hidden letters and numbers 1 centimeter tall. Given the current state of non-line-of-sight vision, quantitative results weren’t practical since the camera inevitably fails to capture an unknown amount of detail). Qualitatively, however, the researchers deemed their system’s output a substantial improvement over the previous state of the art. Moreover, the U-Net is thousands of times faster.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Having been trained on simple generated images, the system perceived only simple outlines. Moreover, the simulation on which the model was trained may not correspond to real-world situations closely enough to be generally useful.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Researchers <em>saw around corners.</em><br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> The current implementation likely is far from practical applications.

Each is working toward that goal from a different angle:</p><ul><li>Bengio, a professor at the Université de Montréal, observed that deep learning’s results are analogous to the type of human thought — which cognitive scientists call system 1 thinking — that is habitual and occurs below the surface of consciousness. He aims to develop systems capable of the more attentive system 2 thinking that enables people to respond effectively to novel situations. He described a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08568?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">consciousness prior,</a> made up of high-level variables with a high probability of being true, that would enable AI agents to track abstract changes in the world. That way, understanding, say, whether a person is wearing glasses would be a matter of one bit rather than many pixels.</li><li>Hinton, who divides his time between Google Brain and the University of Toronto, began by noting the limitations of convolutional neural networks when it comes to understanding three-dimensional objects. The latest version of his <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06818?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">stacked-capsule autoencoder</a> is designed to overcome that issue. The model learns to represent objects independently of their orientation in space, so it can recognize objects despite variations in point of view, lighting, or noise.</li><li>Facebook AI chief LeCun noted that, while supervised learning has accomplished amazing things, it requires tremendous amounts of labeled data. Self-supervised learning, in which a network learns by filling in blanks in input data, opens new vistas. This technique has had great success in language models, but it has yet to work well in visual tasks. To bridge the gap, LeCun is betting on energy-based models that measure compatibility between an observation (such as a segment of video) and the desired prediction (such as the next frame).</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> The Association for Computing Machinery awarded Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun the <a href=\"https://awards.acm.org/about/2018-turing?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">2018 A.

The association credits the trio’s accomplishments, including breakthroughs in backpropagation, computer vision, and natural language processing, with reinvigorating AI.<br><br><strong>Words of wisdom:</strong> Asked by the moderator what students of machine learning should read, Hinton offered the counterintuitive observation that “reading rots the mind.” He recommended that practitioners figure out how they would solve a given problem, and only then read about how others solved it.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> We apologize for rotting your mind.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FaceShifter20ASPECT.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Different examples of FaceShifter working on peoples' portraits \" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"trading-faces\">Trading Faces</h2><p>AI’s ability to transfer a person’s face from a source photo onto someone in a target photo doesn’t work so well when the target face is partially obscured by, say, eyeglasses, a veil, or a hand. A new technique handles such occlusions.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Lingzhi Li at Peking University and collaborators at Microsoft Research propose <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13457?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">FaceShifter</a>, a face-swapping system that reproduces accurately both a source face and elements that block the target.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> It’s easier to reproduce occlusions if you’ve scoped them out ahead of time. FaceShifter takes an extra step to identify occlusions before it renders the final image.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The system has two major components. Adaptive Embedding Integration Network (AEI-Net) spots occlusions and generates a preliminary swap. Heuristic Error Acknowledging Refinement Network (HEAR-Net) then refines the swap.</p><ul><li>AEI-Net identifies troublesome occlusions by using the target image as both source and target. The difference between its input and output highlights any occlusions it failed to reproduce.</li><li>AEI-Net extracts face features from a source image. It learns to extract non-face features from the target image in multiple resolutions, so it can capture larger and smaller shapes.</li><li>AEI-Net’s generator combines these features into an intermediate representation, using attention to focus on the most relevant features.</li><li>HEAR-Net uses the occlusion-only and intermediate images to generate a final image. It’s trained to strike a balance between maintaining the source face’s distinctiveness, minimizing changes in AEI-Net’s output, and reproducing images accurately when the source and target are the same.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers used a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09414?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">pretrained face classifier</a> to evaluate how well FaceShifter maintained the distinctiveness of the source face compared with <a href=\"https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">DeepFakes</a> and <a href=\"https://faceswap.dev/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">FaceSwap</a>.

One solution to this small data problem is to synthesize training examples, such as faux MRIs that accurately portray rare diseases. Another is transfer learning, in which a model trained on an ample dataset is fine-tuned on a much smaller one.</li><li>Businesses can have a tough time finding the right models for their needs, given the shortage of AI specialists and the variety of neural network architectures to choose from.
