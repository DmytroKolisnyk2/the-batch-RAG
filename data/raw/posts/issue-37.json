Tesla pulled back the curtain on what it takes to train its self-driving software to perform this task and others.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Tesla AI chief <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxu4IqwKw0w&index=6&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6FcbHlDzbVzf3TVgxzxK7lr&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Andrej Karpathy</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx7BXih7zx8&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">describes</a> in a video presentation how the electric car maker is moving toward fully autonomous vehicles. Shot at February’s <a href=\"http://scaledml.org/2020/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">ScaledML Conference</a>, the video was posted on YouTube last week.<br><br><strong>Not just a big red hexagon:</strong> Stop signs take a surprising variety of forms and appearances, and that can make them hard to identify. Rather than an oversized icon on a pole, they’re often waved by construction workers, hanging off school buses, or paired with other signs. Karpathy describes how his team trained the company’s Autopilot system to detect a particularly vexing case: stop signs partially obscured by foliage.</p><ul><li>Engineers understood that AutoPilot was having trouble recognizing occluded stop signs because, among other things, the bounding boxes around them flickered.</li><li>Using images from the existing dataset, they trained a model to detect occluded stop signs. They sent this model to the fleet with instructions to send back similar images. This gave them tens of thousands of new examples.</li><li>They used the new examples to improve the model’s accuracy. Then they deployed it to HydraNet, the software that fuses outputs from AutoPilot’s 48 neural networks into a unified, labeled field of view.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Tesla is the only major autonomous driving company that doesn’t use lidar as its primary sensor. Instead, it relies on computer vision with help from radar and ultrasonic sensors. Cameras are relatively cheap, so Tesla can afford to install its self-driving sensor package into every car that comes off the line, even though self-driving software is still in the works. It’s also easier to label pictures than point clouds. The downside: Cameras need a lot of training to sense the world in three dimensions, which lidar units do right out of the box.</p><p><strong>Unstoppable:</strong> Responding to Karpathy’s presentation on Twitter, Google Brain researcher David Ha (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hardmaru?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">@hardmaru</a>) created stop sign doodles using <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03477?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">sketch-rnn</a>, an image generator he and colleague David Eck trained on crude hand-drawn sketches.

New research takes advantage of the effect to recognize the presence of people.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Yang Liu and colleagues at Syracuse University <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05770?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">detected people</a> in a room with a Wi-Fi router by analyzing the signal.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Radio waves interfere with one another, creating high-frequency noise that masks other kinds of perturbations. The researchers removed these components, making it easier to identify lower-frequency disturbances caused by human motion.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> A Wi-Fi router comprises many antennas transmitting and receiving radio waves on different frequency bands called subcarriers. The researchers measured the signal strength and phase received by each antenna over a fixed time period to plot what is known as channel state information (CSI). The sequence of CSI images — cubes corresponding to measurements of the transmitting antenna, receiving antenna, and subcarrier — feeds a network that predicts whether someone is moving in the room</p><ul><li>The researchers extracted CSI components that represent signal strength and phase.</li><li>The pre-processing algorithm transformed these components to the frequency domain to capture change from time step to time step.</li><li>They fed the strength and phase information into a dual-input convolutional neural network, basically a pair of <a href=\"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">AlexNets</a> operating in parallel. The model’s fully connected layers merged the features extracted by each CNN to render a prediction.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors’ method slightly outperformed conventional motion detectors based on infrared beams. The dual CNN detected a wider physical area. Although the training data included only people walking, it spotted minimal motion — say, typing on a keyboard while seated — almost twice as well as conventional detectors. (The success rate was only around 5 percent, but for much of the time, typing was the only motion to detect.) It may miss someone if they’re still, but combining multiple predictions over time improved accuracy unless someone was still for minutes on end.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> The training and test data come from the same room, so the model’s practicality is limited for now. It would be onerous to retrain for each new room we might use it in.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It’s hard to imagine extracting this kind of information from radio waves without deep learning. Still, the preprocessing step was crucial. Neural networks can be distracted by input features that don’t correlate with the output. Radio interference doesn’t correlate with human motion, so the CNN would have required a huge amount of data to learn to detect people through the noise. Removing it at the outset made training far more efficient.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> It is well known that powerful actions can create a disturbance in the Force. But anyone can create a disturbance in the Wi-Fi.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Road.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Series of images and data related to a tool that maps where hurricanes and other calamities have wiped out roads\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"roads-to-recovery\">Roads to Recovery</h3><p>Deep learning promises to help emergency responders find their way through disaster zones.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> MIT researchers developed a <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2020/lidar-and-ai-road-status-clears-after-disaster-0415?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">tool</a> that maps where hurricanes and other calamities have wiped out roads, helping to show aid workers the fastest ways to get to people in need.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Since 2017, following hurricanes in the Carolinas, Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico, aircraft equipped with lidar collected three-dimensional images of the devastated landscapes.

A horizontal line of elevated lidar points that crosses a road, for instance, could be a downed tree. A sudden drop in elevation could be a washed-out bridge.</li><li>They merged the road and obstruction output into <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io#map=4/38.00/-95.84\" rel=\" noopener\">OpenStreetMap</a> and built an algorithm that finds the optimal route from place to place while avoiding impassable roads.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> In tests, the group was able to fly a lidar mission, process data, and generate route-finding analytics in under 36 hours.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> After disaster strikes, damaged infrastructure often thwarts efforts by emergency responders and relief groups to deliver food and medical care to those in need.

Once it knows the walls and rooms they form, generating a floor plan is easy.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> 3D scanners project light and measure how long it takes to bounce back, producing a point cloud that represents the scene. In an empty room, these points are likely to belong to walls.</p><ul><li>The team started by creating a synthetic training dataset. They generated random 2D shapes divided into sub-shapes, all made of straight lines. Then they extended the shapes and sub-shapes into a third dimension and placed 3D points on the sub-shape boundaries to represent walls.</li><li>The team adapted <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02413?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">PointNet++</a>, a neural net designed to process sets of points.
