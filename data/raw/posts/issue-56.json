The system can step in when a card issuer — generally a bank that normally would vet such transactions — suffers a network outage that makes it impossible to assess creditworthiness.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> If a cardholder’s purchases are blocked, they might switch to another card, costing the bank revenue and possibly a customer. And if a miscreant tries to commit fraud, the bank stands to lose money. So Visa provides a backup system that predicts the decision in case the lender can’t due to software glitches, severe weather, or routine maintenance.</p><ul><li>The new model is trained on the company’s database of historical transactions. It learns an individual’s normal behavior based on factors like spending history, location, and timing of transactions.</li><li>In tests, it matched banks’ decisions with 95 percent accuracy. An earlier, rule-based algorithm was half as accurate, according to a report by the <em><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/visa-unveils-more-powerful-ai-tool-that-approves-or-denies-card-transactions-11598436001?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Wall Street Journal</a></em>.</li><li>Visa plans to make the service available for a fee starting in October.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Unlike, say, fraud detection, this model touches cardholders directly to improve the customer experience. It points the way toward public-facing models that personalize banking, credit, and other financial arrangements.</p><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Visa declined to share details of its new algorithm with <em>The Batch</em>. Decisions to extend credit can be based on patterns in data that encode social biases, and an algorithm trained on a biased dataset will reflect its biases. For instance, an algorithm may decline transactions requested by a cardholder whose home address is in a neighborhood associated with defaults on loans, and accept those requested by someone with a comparable history of repayment who lives in a wealthier neighborhood. Large financial institutions are aware of this problem, but standards that specify what is and isn’t fair are still in development.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>The financial industry’s health depends on trust. That should provide ample incentive to define the fairness of automated systems in lending and other financial services. Efforts such as Singapore’s <a href=\"https://www.mas.gov.sg/publications/monographs-or-information-paper/2018/FEAT?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Principles to Promote Fairness, Ethics, and Transparency</a> are an important step.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SimCLRv2.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Graphs comparing SimCLR to SimCLRv2\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"fewer-labels-more-learning\">Fewer Labels, More Learning</h3><p>Large models pretrained in an unsupervised fashion and then fine-tuned on a smaller corpus of labeled data have achieved spectacular results in natural language processing. New research pushes forward with a similar approach to computer vision.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Ting Chen and colleagues at Google Brain developed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">SimCLRv2</a>, a training method for image recognition that outperformed the state of the art in self-supervised learning and beat fully supervised models while using a small fraction of the labels. The new work extends their earlier <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">SimCLR,</a> which <em>The Batch</em> reported on <a href=\"https://blog.deeplearning.ai/blog/the-batch-ai-versus-coronavirus-quantum-neural-networks-workers-prepare-for-job-losses-translating-cuneiform?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">here</a>.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Larger models have proven more effective in self-supervised pretraining. But enormous models can be hard to deploy and run efficiently. SimCLRv2 starts with a giant feature extractor, fine-tunes the resulting features, and shrinks the final model using <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">knowledge distillation</a>. The result is a model of more reasonable size that achieves high accuracy despite training on relatively few labeled examples.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The most novel aspect of the original SimCLR was its use of image augmentation to train a feature extractor via contrastive learning. SimCLRv2 follows that pattern, but it uses deeper models and distills the trained architecture.</p><ul><li>The authors started by pretraining a feature extractor to generate similar features from augmented versions of the same image, and dissimilar features from unrelated images.</li><li>Next, they fine-tuned the feature extractor using subsets of <a href=\"http://www.image-net.org/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">ImageNet</a>. They ran experiments using either 1 percent or 10 percent of the labels.</li><li>The final step was knowledge distillation: A teacher model trained a student model to match its predictions on unlabeled data. The authors achieved equally good results from both self-distillation (in which the teacher and student share the same architecture) and conventional distillation (in which the student is a more compact model).</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">resnet-50</a> trained via SimCLRv2 using 10 percent of ImageNet labels outperformed a supervised resnet-50 trained on all the labels. It achieved a top-1 accuracy of 77.5 percent, an 8.7 percent improvement over the previous <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12848?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">state of the art</a> on the task with similar architecture and label constraints, versus the supervised model’s 76.6 percent. A resnet-152 (three times wider with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06586?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">selective kernels</a>) trained via SimCLRv2 that used 1 percent of ImageNet labels matched a supervised resnet-50, achieving 76.6 percent top-1 accuracy. That’s 13.6 percent better than the previous best model trained on the same number of labels.<br><br><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Techniques that make it possible to train neural networks effectively on relatively few labeled images could have an impact on small data problems such as diagnosing medical images and detecting defects on a manufacturing line, where labeled examples are hard to come by. The progress from SimCLR to SimCLRv2 bodes well for further advances.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>Self-supervised models tend to be huge partly because it isn’t clear initially what they’ll be used for, so they must learn lots of general-purpose features. Knowledge distillation looks like a promising way to trim the extra features for specific purposes in which a smaller network may suffice.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-optimize202-2.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Animation of the universe\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"planet-hunter\">Planet Hunter</h3><p>A machine learning model is scouring the cosmos for undiscovered planets.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Astronomers from the University of Warwick <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10516?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">developed</a> a system that learned to identify faraway worlds in a dataset of thousands of candidates.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Astronomers often <a href=\"https://earthsky.org/space/how-do-astronomers-discover-exoplanets?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io#:~:text=Bottom%20line%3A%20The%20most%20popular,by%20direct%20imaging%20and%20microlensing\" rel=\" noopener\">find</a> planets outside Earth’s solar system, or exoplanets, by scanning the sky for stars that flicker, which indicates that a planet might pass in front of them. Given a set of possible planets, the researchers used machine learning to sift out false positives caused by camera errors, cosmic rays, or stars eclipsing one another to identify the real deal.</p><ul><li>The researchers trained several models using data that represents thousands of verified exoplanets among thousands of false positives, gathered by the retired Kepler space telescope. They tested the models on a large dataset of confirmed candidates.</li><li>Out of nine different models, four — a Gaussian process classifier, random forest, extra trees classifier, and neural network — achieved top scores for area under the curve (AUC), precision, and recall.</li><li>The authors double-checked their models’ conclusions against an established exoplanet validation technique, which didn’t always agree. They advocate using both approaches rather than relying on one or the other.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> In some test cases when the authors’ models and the earlier technique disagreed strongly, their approach identified confirmed exoplanets that the old approach missed. Similarly, the authors identified a preponderance of confirmed false positives that the earlier approach classified as planets with greater than 99 percent confidence.</p><p><strong>What’s next:</strong> The authors’ models analyzed 2,680 unconfirmed candidates and classified 83 likely exoplanets. The earlier technique agreed that 50 of them were bona fide exoplanets — prime targets for further study. The authors hope to apply their method to the dataset collected from NASA’s recent Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission, which contains thousands more unconfirmed candidates.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Any indirect method of determining an exoplanet’s existence is bound to be imperfect. By combining approaches, researchers aim to improve the likelihood that what they take to be planets really are, so scientists can proceed with deeper investigations.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Outer space offers an endless supply of data, and machine learning is the ultimate tool for crunching it.

Thus, the size of a country’s data trove doesn’t translate directly into power. A more important factor is the degree to which a country can use data to gain an edge in developing military systems.</p><ul><li>Unlike the U.S. government, China has the power to requisition vast troves of commercial data for military use.

Oversimplifications of the value of data don’t help us find the right data to make our systems work.
