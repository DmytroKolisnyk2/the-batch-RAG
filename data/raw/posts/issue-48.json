The pandemic is accelerating that education.<br><br><strong>What’s happening:</strong> Companies like Instrumental and Elementary are making AI-powered cameras that automate the spotting of damaged or badly assembled products on factory assembly lines, <em><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/factories-inspector-robot-check-work/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Wired</a></em> reports. (For the record, deeplearning.ai’s sister company Landing AI is, too.)<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Instrumental’s quality-control system first learns to recognize components in their ideal state and then to identify defects. It can spot faulty screws, disfigured circuit boards, and flaws in the protective coating on smartphone screens.</p><ul><li>Cameras along the assembly line take photos of products in the making. The manufacturer’s engineers review the images and label defects. The labeled data is used to fine-tune the system.</li><li>Manufacturers often don’t allow outsiders direct access to their equipment, so Instrumental’s engineers typically tweak systems on-site. Amid the pandemic, though, <a href=\"https://www.instrumental.com/case-studies/builds-without-engineers-how-instrumental-customers-are-thriving-in-npi-ramp-and-production-without-travel?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">five clients</a> are allowing the company to monitor the assembly line remotely, making it possible to update the computer vision model on the fly.</li></ul><p><strong>Coming soon:</strong> Elementary plans to install robotic cameras in a U.S. Toyota plant. Workers will place a completed part beneath the camera for inspection, then press a button to indicate whether they agree with the robot’s assessment to fine-tune the model.<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> <a href=\"https://automation.omron.com/en/us/products/families/vision-systems?filters=type%3D%3Dproduct&filters=category%3D%3Dvision-systems&pageSize=10&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Omron</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cognex.com/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Cognex</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ussvision.com/multi-view?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">USS Vision</a> have sold non-neural inspection systems for decades. Neural networks are making their way into the field as engineers develop techniques for learning what flaws look like from small numbers of examples.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Earlier automated inspection systems use hand-coded rules to identify specific flaws. Machine learning promises to be more adaptable and quicker to deploy. That could speed up assembly lines and cut manufacturing costs.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> The ability to learn from small amounts of data is the key to many applications of deep learning that are still beyond reach.

A new network understands the image-text combo. (This is the second of three papers presented by Amazon at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). We’ll cover the third one next time.)<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Online stores offer all kinds of clothing, but search engines may suggest items of a different color or style than you want. <a href=\"https://assets.amazon.science/01/7b/af090cd94d609a6d9d5a75764e1d/scipub-1303.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Visiolinguistic Attention Learning</a>, developed by Yanbei Chen with researchers at Queen Mary University of London and Amazon, hones product searches based on text input from shoppers.<br><br><strong>Key insights:</strong> If you can create a picture that approximates the ideal product, you can search for similar images. Generating realistic images is hard, but comparing extracted features is much easier.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> VAL learns to modify features extracted from a product image according to text input such as “I want it to have a light floral pattern.” Then it searches for other products with features similar to the modified product features.</p><ul><li>VAL learned from datasets that provide an image paired with text as input, and a photo of the corresponding product as output.</li><li>VAL contains a text encoder network and an image encoder network. The image encoder extracts image features at a few levels of detail, for instance shapes and textures.</li><li>A pair of transformers fuses the text and image features at each level of detail.</li><li>One transformer is a variation on self-attention <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">transformers</a>. It identifies relationships between image and text features, and adjusts the image features to agree with the text features.</li><li>The second transformer learns to identify features that are unchanged in the new product and copies them without modification.</li><li>The element-wise sum of both transformers comprises the desired product’s features. VAL compares them with features extracted from product images in its database and returns the closest matches.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers put VAL head-to-head against <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07119?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">TIRG</a>, the previous state of the art in image search with text feedback using the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01311.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Fashion200K</a> dataset of garment photos with text descriptions.

In an appealing twist, some articles that human publishers had tried to tart up with clickbait — for instance, <em>You’ll Never Guess Which U.S. Counties Grew the Fastest</em> — the model gave a sensible, informative headline: <em>MacKenzie County in North Dakota Had Highest Population Growth in Entire U.S.</em><br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> A headline is a very short document summary. Summarizers come in two flavors. Extractive models use only sentences or phrases from the text itself, building summaries that are closely related to the source but may be narrow or off-point. Abstractive models create new text based on an independent dictionary, synthesizing fresh but potentially confused summaries. Primer developed a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08455?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">hybrid model</a> that generates abstractive headlines using vocabulary found in the document.</p><ul><li>The authors fine-tuned a Bert Question-Answer model from Hugging Face on 1.5 million news story/headline pairs drawn from sources including the <em>New York Times</em>, BBC, and CBC.</li><li>The model frames headline generation as a series of question-answer tasks. The question is the beginning of the headline and the answer is the passage that makes up the next part. The model iterates this process sequentially through the document.</li><li>The researchers also adapted the model to create bullet-point summaries of news articles, financial reports, and even movie plots — though not perfect. For instance, it declared that the character named Maverick in the 1986 Tom Cruise hit Top Gun enters a romantic relationship with his co-pilot Goose, rather than his instructor, per the actual plot.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Human evaluators each read 100 news stories and graded two accompanying headlines, one written by a person and the other by the model. The computer-generated headlines scored slightly better overall. The model performed best on short-form journalism but stumbled on longer articles, probably because key information in longer items is more spread out.<br><br><strong>Behind the News:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhiyuan_Liu/publication/318364827_Recent_Advances_on_Neural_Headline_Generation/links/59eb6927a6fdccef8b0c569d/Recent-Advances-on-Neural-Headline-Generation.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Earlier</a> headline generation methods mostly use an encoder-decoder to produce abstractive results. Unlike the new model, the encoder-decoder approach can generate any possible headline but risks poor grammar, factual inaccuracy, and general incoherence.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Imagine a world without clickbait!<br><br><strong>We’re wondering:</strong> The computer wrote option A.
