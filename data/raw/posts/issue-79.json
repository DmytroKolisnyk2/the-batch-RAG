But when data is scarce, consider using the data to augment human insight, so people can make better decisions.</em></p><p><em>Let me illustrate this point with A/B testing. The common understanding of the process is:</em></p><ul><li><em>Build two versions of your product. For example, on the DeepLearning.AI website, one version might say, “Build your career with DeepLearning.AI,” and another, “Grow your skills with DeepLearning.AI.”</em></li><li><em>Show both versions to groups of users chosen at random and collect data on their behavior.</em></li><li><em>Launch the version that results in better engagement (or another relevant metric).</em></li></ul><p><em>But this is not how I typically use A/B testing. Often I run such tests to gain insight, not to choose which product to launch. Here‘s how it works:</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-17-at-9.37.46-AM-copy.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A/B Test loop for building human insight\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><ul><li><em>Build two versions of your product.</em></li><li><em>Have the product team make predictions about which version will perform better.</em></li><li><em>Test both versions and collect data on user behavior.</em></li><li><em>Show the results to the team, and let them influence their beliefs about users and their reactions. If someone says, “Oh, that’s weird. I didn’t realize our users wanted that!” then we’ve learned something valuable.</em></li><li><em>Based on the team’s revised intuitions, have them decide what to launch. It could be version A, version B, or something else.</em></li><li><em>Repeat until you reach diminishing returns in terms of learning.</em></li></ul><p><em>On major websites, where the developers may run thousands of automated experiments a day — for example, trying out different ad placements to see who clicks on what — it’s not possible for people to look at every experimental result to hone their intuition. In this case, fully or mostly automated decision making works well. An algorithm can try multiple versions and pick the one that achieves the best metrics (or use the data to learn what to show a given user). But when the number of daily experiments is small, using such experiments to hone your intuition allows you to combine limited trials with human insight to arrive at a better decision.</em><br><br><em>Beyond A/B testing, the same concept applies to building machine learning systems. If your dataset size is modest, combining data-derived insights with human insights is critical. For example, you might do careful error analysis to derive insights and then design a system architecture that captures how you would carry out the task. If you have a massive amount of data, more automation — perhaps a large end-to-end learning algorithm — can work. But even then, error analysis and human insight still play important roles.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h2 id=\"news\">News</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FDA.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Series of images showing a variety of medical AI products\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"medical-ai%E2%80%99s-hidden-data\">Medical AI’s Hidden Data</h2><p>U.S. government approval of medical AI products is on the upswing — but information about how such systems were built is largely unavailable.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a plethora of AI-driven medical systems. But, unlike drugs, there’s a dearth of publicly available information about how well they work, according to an investigation by the health-news website <em><a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/03/fda-clearances-artificial-intelligence-data/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stat News</a></em>.<br><br><strong>What they found:</strong> The FDA doesn’t require makers of AI systems to provide systematic documentation of their development and validation processes, such as the composition of training and test datasets and the populations involved. The data actually provided by manufacturers varies widely.</p><ul><li><em>Stat News</em> compiled a list of <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/03/fda-artificial-intelligence-clearance-products/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">161 products</a> that were approved between 2012 and 2020. Most are imaging systems trained to recognize signs of stroke, cancer, or other conditions. Others monitor heartbeats, predict fertility status, or analyze blood loss.</li><li>The makers of only 73 of those products disclosed the number of patients in the test dataset. In those cases, the number of patients ranged from less than 100 to more than 15,000.</li><li>The manufacturers of fewer than 40 products revealed whether the data they used for training and testing had come from more than one facility — an important factor in proving the product’s general utility. Makers of 13 products broke down their study population by gender. Seven did so by race.</li><li>A few companies said they had tested and validated their product on a large, diverse population, but that information was not publicly available.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> The rate at which the FDA approves medical AI products is rising and could reach 600 products annually by 2025, according to <em>Stat News</em>.</p><ul><li>Most such products currently are approved under a standard that requires demonstrating “<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/premarket-submissions/premarket-notification-510k?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io#se\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">substantial equivalence</a>” in safety and efficacy to similar, already-approved systems. This standard, known as <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-approvals-denials-and-clearances/510k-clearances?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">510(k)</a>, was established in 1976 without medical AI in mind.</li><li>A recent FDA <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/software-medical-device-samd/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-software-medical-device?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">action plan</a> for regulating AI aims to compel manufacturers to evaluate their products more rigorously.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Without consistent requirements for testing and reporting, the FDA can’t ensure that AI systems will render accurate diagnoses, recommend appropriate treatments, or treat minority populations fairly. This leaves health care providers to figure out for themselves whether a product works as advertised with their particular equipment and patients.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> If you don’t know how an AI system was trained and tested, you can’t evaluate the risk of concept or data drift as real-world conditions and data distributions change. This is a problem even in drug testing: A vaccine validated against the dominant Covid-19 variant may become less effective as the virus mutates. Researchers are developing tools to combat such drifts in AI systems. Let’s make sure they’re deployed in medical AI.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/UNDERSPEC-1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Different data related to the phenomenon called underspecification\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"facing-failure-to-generalize\">Facing Failure to Generalize</h2><p>The same models trained on the same data may show the same performance in the lab, and yet respond very differently to data they haven’t seen before. New work finds this inconsistency to be pervasive.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers explored this largely unexamined phenomenon, which they call <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03395?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">underspecification</a>. The team, led by Alexander D’Amour, Katherine Heller, and Dan Moldovan, spanned Google, MIT, Stanford, University of California San Diego, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Aravind Eye Hospital, and Shri Bhagwan Mahavir Vitreo-Retinal Services.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> A well specified model pipeline — a model architecture, hyperparameters, training and test sets, and training procedure — should produce models that behave consistently. In practice, though, the same pipeline can produce many distinct models that achieve near-optimal performance, only some of which generalize to real-world conditions. Building a plethora of models and testing each one is the only way to know which is which.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors built many models per pipeline across a range of machine learning applications. Then they compared their performance on an appropriate test set and alternative data. The tests fell into three categories:</p><ul><li>The authors probed whether models produced using the same pipeline performed equally well on particular subsets of a test set. For example, with vision models that were trained to recognize an eye disease, they compared performance on images taken by different cameras.</li><li>They compared performance on an established test set and a similar one with a different distribution. For instance, they compared the performance of ImageNet-trained models on both ImageNet and ObjectNet, which depicts some ImageNet classes from different angles and against different backgrounds.</li><li>They also compared performance on examples that were modified. For instance, using a model that was trained to evaluate similarity between two sentences, they switched genders, comparing the similarity of “a man is walking” and “a doctor is walking” versus “a woman is walking” and “a doctor is walking.”</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors found highly variable performance in models produced by identical model pipelines for several practical tasks in language, vision, and healthcare. For instance, they trained 50 <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ResNet-50</a> models on <a href=\"http://www.image-net.org/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ImageNet</a> using the same pipeline except for differing random seeds. On ImageNet’s test set, the standard deviation from top-1 accuracy was 0.001. On <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/2235448?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ImageNet-C</a>, which comprises corrupted ImageNet examples that are still recognizable to humans, the standard deviation was 0.024. A given model’s performance on one dataset didn’t correlate with its performance on the other.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> If our models are to be useful and trustworthy, they must deliver consistent results. Underspecification is a significant barrier to that goal.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> This work offers a helpful framework to evaluate the model performance on similar-but-different data. But how can we specify model pipelines to produce consistent models? We eagerly await further studies in this area.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-02-09T103736.475.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Data showing information related to AI strategy status in OECD countries \" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"computation-as-a-national-resource\">Computation as a National Resource</h2><p>How much processing power do various nations have on hand to drive their AI strategy?

Transformers use residual connections throughout, which imposes a one-to-one correspondence between the network’s input and output. That correspondence could preserve word order in representations extracted from a languages (for example, remembering that adjectives precede the nouns they describe), which causes problems for zero-shot translation if the output language orders adjectives and nouns differently. Removing residual connections in one layer should break the correspondence while preserving the benefits of residual connections in other layers.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors used a transformer and removed the residual connections from its encoder’s middle layer.</p><ul><li>They trained the model on <a href=\"https://www.statmt.org/europarl/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Europarl v7</a>, <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/iwsltevaluation2017/TED-tasks?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IWSLT 2017</a>, and <a href=\"http://data.statmt.org/pmindia/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PMIndia</a>, which include texts in various languages paired with human translations into other languages.</li><li>The model learned to translate between 18 language pairs that always included English.
