I was reminded that most capabilities — in humans or in AI — develop slowly.</p><p>Some people fear that AI someday will learn&nbsp;to deceive humans deliberately. If that ever happens, I’m sure we will see it coming from far away and have plenty of time to stop it.</p><p>While I was counting to 10 with my eyes closed, my daughter (age 5) recruited my son (age 3) to tell me she was hiding in the bathroom while she actually hid in the closet. But her stage whisper, interspersed with giggling, was so loud I heard her instructions clearly. And my son’s performance when he pointed to the bathroom was so hilariously overdramatic, I had to stifle a smile.</p><p>Perhaps they will learn to trick me someday, but not yet! (In his awful performance, I think my son takes after me. To this day, I have a terrible poker face — which is matched by my perfect lifetime record of losing every poker game I have ever played!)</p><p>Last year, the paper “<a href=\"https://papers.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/adc98a266f45005c403b8311ca7e8bd7-Paper-Conference.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--5PGGtWHSdR9WiP2NQdl-zE4xfe2Lyhu3oR-OBcHjmKt_5hJ6MuBDWGPd4Ek2zfxruKHcp\" rel=\"noopener\">Are Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models a Mirage?</a>” by Rylan Schaeffer, Brando Miranda, and Sanmi Koyejo, which won a NeurIPS outstanding paper award, considered “emergent” properties of LLMs, which refers to capabilities that seem to appear suddenly as model sizes increase. The authors point out that scaling laws imply that the per-token error rate decreases (improves) slowly with scale, and emergent properties might be an artifact of researchers studying nonlinear or discontinuous metrics that transform a gradually decreasing per-token error rate into something that looks more like a step function.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/09/unnamed--10--1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Comic where a robot is hiding in a closet during a game of hide-and-seek.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/09/unnamed--10--1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/09/unnamed--10--1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/09/unnamed--10--1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Consider a “combination lock” metric that requires getting many items right. Say we’re measuring the likelihood that an LLM will get 10 independent digits of an answer right. If the odds of it getting each digit right improve gradually from 0 to 1, then the odds of it getting all 10 digits right will appear to jump suddenly. But if we look at continuous metrics, such as the total number of correct digits, we will see that the underlying performance actually improves gradually.

Or, looking back further in AI history, even though AlphaGo’s victory over Lee Sedol in the game of Go took the public by surprise, it actually represented many years of gradual improvements in AI’s ability to play Go.</p><p>While analogies between human and machine learning can be misleading, I think that just as a person’s ability to do math, to reason — or to deceive — grows gradually, so will AI’s. This means the capabilities of AI technology will grow gradually (although I wish we could achieve AGI overnight!), and the ability of AI to be used in harmful applications, too, will grow gradually.

It was negotiated by member nations of the Council of Europe (a transnational organization that promotes democracy and human rights and includes nearly twice as many countries as the EU) as well as observer states including Australia, Canada, and Mexico, which have not yet signed it. Countries that did not participate include China, India, Japan, and Russia.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The treaty will take effect later this year. It applies to any use of AI by signatories, private actors working on behalf of signatories, or actors in those jurisdictions. AI is broadly defined as any “machine-based system . . . [that generates] predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that may influence physical or virtual environments.” The signatories agreed to do the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Ensure that all AI systems are consistent with human-rights obligations and democratic processes, including individual rights to participate in fair debate</li><li>Prohibit any use of AI that would discriminate against individuals on the basis of gender or other characteristics protected by international or domestic law</li><li>Protect individual privacy rights and personal data against uses by AI</li><li>Assess AI systems for risk and impact before making them widely available&nbsp;</li><li>Promote digital literacy and skills to ensure public understanding of AI&nbsp;</li><li>Notify individuals when they are interacting with an AI system</li><li>Shut down or otherwise mitigate AI systems when they risk violating human rights</li><li>Establish oversight mechanisms to ensure compliance with the treaty and provide remedies for violations</li></ul><p><strong>Exceptions:&nbsp;</strong>The treaty allows exceptions for national security and doesn’t cover military applications and national defense. It also doesn’t apply to research and development of AI systems that are not yet available for general use, unless testing such systems can interfere with human rights, democracy, or the rule of law.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Behind the news:&nbsp;</strong>The Council of Europe oversees the European Convention on Human Rights and its Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France.

Since so many AI companies are based in the U.S. and Europe, the treaty may influence corporate practices worldwide. Its provisions could shape the design of deployed AI systems.</p><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong>&nbsp;Like any regulation, the treaty’s effectiveness depends on the interpretation of its high-level concepts. Its core terms (such as accountability measures, democratic processes, oversight, privacy rights, and transparency) represent a broad framework, but their precise meaning&nbsp; is vague and interpretation is left to the signatories. Also, the nonparticipation of major AI powers like China and large countries like Russia and India raises questions about whether its standards can be applied globally.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:&nbsp;</strong>The EU and U.S. have very different approaches to AI regulation; the EU has taken a much heavier hand. Yet both agreed to the treaty. This could indicate that these regions are finding common ground, which could lead to more uniform regulations internationally.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/09/unnamed--6-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Hierarchical K-means diagram with data clustering across multiple layers.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/09/unnamed--6-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"balancing-web-data-distributions\">Balancing Web Data Distributions</h1><p>Datasets that were scraped from the web tend to be unbalanced, meaning examples of some classes (say, cats) are plentiful while examples of others (say, caterpillars) are scarce.

An automated method addresses such imbalances.</p><p><strong>What’s new:&nbsp;</strong>Huy V.

But this approach tends to form many clusters in areas of the distribution that have more examples, leading to over-representation of certain categories. For instance, when the authors applied k-means to web images and associated the clusters with their nearest neighbors in ImageNet, around 300 clusters (out of 10,000) corresponded to the ImageNet class “website.” However, after clustering, the distribution of the centroids is a bit more uniform than that of the entire dataset. Applying k-means repeatedly distributes the centroids (and thus the clusters) more uniformly. After a number of iterations, each cluster is more likely to represent a distinct category, and selecting equal numbers of examples from each cluster makes a balanced dataset.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors balanced image and text datasets using several iterations of k-means clustering. Their image dataset started with 743 million examples from a “publicly available repository of crawled web data.” For text, they started with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.494/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--5PGGtWHSdR9WiP2NQdl-zE4xfe2Lyhu3oR-OBcHjmKt_5hJ6MuBDWGPd4Ek2zfxruKHcp\" rel=\"noopener\">CCNet</a>, a version of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://commoncrawl.org/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--5PGGtWHSdR9WiP2NQdl-zE4xfe2Lyhu3oR-OBcHjmKt_5hJ6MuBDWGPd4Ek2zfxruKHcp\" rel=\"noopener\">Common Crawl</a>&nbsp;that was filtered to match the distribution of language and topics found in Wikipedia.
