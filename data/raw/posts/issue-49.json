The authors believe their system is the first mobile robot capable of running lab experiments. <br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> In a recent study, the articulated arm on wheels completed 688 experiments, testing various hypotheses to extract hydrogen from water efficiently using chemicals and light.</p><ul><li>The system navigates using lidar, so it can operate in the dark.</li><li>The researchers divided the lab into a series of stations devoted to specific procedures. Upon arriving at each station, the arm calibrated its position by tapping the sides of cubes that the scientists had mounted next to each piece of gear.</li><li>The arm is topped with a gripper for mixing chemical samples and operating laboratory equipment.</li><li>A Bayesian optimization model uses the results of each experiment to update the next round by adjusting one of 10 variables, such as the chemical mixture.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The study discovered chemical formulae that made it easier to separate hydrogen from oxygen in water. More important, it proved that a robot can do such work effectively, speedily, and without interruption. The authors estimate that a human scientist would have taken 1,000 times longer to produce similar results.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The authors hope to offer robots for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21317052/mobile-autonomous-robot-lab-assistant-research-speed?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">sale</a> within 18 months. The $150,000-plus price tag might be a bargain if the Covid-19 pandemic makes in-person lab experimentation unfeasible.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>Most factory automation involves stationary robots positioned along a manufacturing line. Perhaps mobile manipulation — where the arm moves to the object being manipulated — will prove to be more efficient for automating science labs.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CSA-Net.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Information and data related to Category-based Subspace Attention Network (CSA-Net)\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"which-shoes-go-with-that-outfit\">Which Shoes Go With That Outfit?</h3><p>Need a wardrobe upgrade? You could ask the fashion mavens at Netflix’s Queer Eye — or you could use a new neural network.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Yen-Liang Lin, Son Tran, and Larry S. Davis at Amazon propose <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08967?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Category-based Subspace Attention Network</a> (CSA-Net) to predict and retrieve compatible garments and accessories that complement one another. (This is the third of three papers presented by Amazon at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). We covered the others in previous issues.)<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Suppose you have several items that go together and want one more to complete the ensemble. Past approaches such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08589?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">SCE-Net</a> can find compatible outfits by scoring pairs of garments or accessories, but Amazon’s catalogue is too vast to compare every pair of items in it. CSA-Net retrieves items by learning a vector description of each item and finding nearby items. The network adjusts its representation based on the categories already selected. For instance, given a shirt and shoes, it can find a matching handbag or hat.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers trained CSA-Net by providing outfits to complete, sets of candidate items, and labels that identify compatible candidates. CSA-Net learned to place outfits and compatible items nearby in the feature space while placing incompatible items farther away.</p><ul><li>A convolutional neural network learns features from an image of a garment or accessory.</li><li>An attention mechanism modifies the features to place different types of items that go together — matching shirts and pants, matching pants and shoes — in distinct subspaces, or portions of the feature space.</li><li>Presented with several items that comprise an incomplete outfit, CSA-Net predicts a missing item by pairing it with each item separately. Say you have a hat, pants, and shoes, and you want a top. The system looks for a top that goes with your hat, then a top that goes with your pants, and so on. It settles on the top that’s nearest to every other item.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers evaluated CSA-Net on the <a href=\"http://www.lib4dev.in/info/xthan/polyvore-dataset/101452760?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Polyvore-Outfit </a>dataset of fashion items and labels that detail their compatibility. Provided an incomplete outfit of four items, CSA-Net predicted the correct fifth piece 59.26 percent of the time, compared with 53.67 percent achieved by the previous <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08589?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">state of the art</a>. It also outperformed the previous state of the art in predicting whether a pair of garments is compatible, achieving a higher area under the curve (the probability of predicting a positive match instead of a negative match).<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The universe of fashion items and accessories is immense and complex, posing a challenge for matching items situated in a feature space. CSA-Net makes the task more tractable by restructuring the feature space into compatible subspaces.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Leave it to machine learning engineers to build technology that liberates them from having to decide which shirt goes with what pants and shoes.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corporate202.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Photorealistic talking head generated by Synthesia\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"deepfakes-go-corporate\">Deepfakes Go Corporate</h3><p>The same technology that has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/31/scarlett-johansson-fake-ai-generated-sex-videos-nothing-can-stop-someone-cutting-pasting-my-image/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">bedeviled</a> Hollywood stars and <a href=\"https://www.brusselstimes.com/all-news/belgium-all-news/politics/106320/xr-belgium-posts-deepfake-of-belgian-premier-linking-covid-19-with-climate-crisis/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">roiled</a> politics is easing corporate communications.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.synthesia.io/about?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Synthesia</a> generates training and sales videos featuring photorealistic, synthetic talking heads that read personalized scripts in any of 34 languages, <em><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/covid-drives-real-businesses-deepfake-technology/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Wired</a></em> reports.

But how much of the world breaks down into perfect polyhedra? New work explores an alternative activation function that yields curvaceous results.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Stanford researchers led by Vincent Sitzmann and Julien Martel developed the periodic activation function <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09661?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">sin(x)</a> to solve equations with well defined higher-order derivatives. They showed preliminary success in a range of applications.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Training a neural network updates its weights to approximate a particular function. Backprop uses the first derivative to train networks more efficiently than methods such as hill-climbing that explore only nearby values. Higher-order derivatives contain useful information that ReLU can’t express and other activation functions describe poorly. For example, in the range 0 to 1, the values of x and x2 are similar, but their derivatives are dramatically different. Sine has better-behaved derivatives.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Sine networks, which the researchers call sirens, are simply neural networks that use sine activation functions. However, they need good initial values.</p><ul><li>A sine network can use layers, regularization, and backprop just like a ReLU network.</li><li>The derivative of a ReLU is a step function, and the second derivative is zero. The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), which is a shifted sine. Since the derivative of a sine network is another sine network, sine networks can learn as much about the derivative as the original data.</li><li>Since successive layers combine sine functions, their oscillations may become very frequent. Hectic oscillations make training  difficult. The researchers avoided this pitfall by generating initialization values that maintain a low frequency.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors used sine networks to solve differential equations (where they can learn directly from derivatives), interpret point clouds, and process images and audio. They provide <a href=\"https://vsitzmann.github.io/siren/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">examples</a> and a <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/vsitzmann/siren/blob/master/explore_siren.ipynb?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">collab notebook</a> so you can try it yourself.
