Instead of building and training separate models to run on a variety of hardware, a new approach trains a single network that can be adapted to any device.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Han Cai and researchers at MIT developed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09791?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Once-for-All </a>(OFA). This method trains a single large model and derives subnetworks — subsets of the original model’s weights — that perform well on less powerful processors.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Typical pruning methods downsize neural networks one at a time by reducing, say, the size and number of convolutional filters and then fine-tuning the smaller model. It’s more efficient to extract and fine-tune a fleet of progressively smaller models in a single process.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> OFA extracts subnetworks by varying the parent network’s number of layers, number of filters per layer, filter sizes, and the input resolution. The researchers constrained each of these factors to a predetermined set of values that allow up to 1019 possible subnetworks.</p><ul><li>OFA trains the original network, then randomly samples a slightly smaller version. Then it fine-tunes both.</li><li>It repeats this procedure with ever smaller subnetworks until it arrives at the smallest allowable version.</li><li>OFA randomly samples and evaluates 10,000 subnetworks. The results constitute a dataset that represents model performance at a given size.</li><li>Using the new dataset, OFA trains another network to predict the accuracy of any subnetwork, so it can select the best network of a given size.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors compared OFA with a variety of neural architecture search methods suitable for finding models for mobile devices. The popular NASNet-A required 48,000 hours to generate the smallest model, and it would require that time again to generate another one optimized for different constraints. OFA’s baseline model required 1,200 hours to find all models. They also compared OFA to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02244?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">MobileNetV3-Large</a>, the state-of-the-art image recognition network for mobile devices.

The most accurate neural search method the researchers considered, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03443v3.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">FBNet-C</a>, required roughly half as much time as OFA to generate a single, less accurate model, but much more time to generate the second.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> OFA produces equivalent models of many sizes in slightly more time than it takes to train the original large models. In situations that require deploying a given network to heterogenous devices, this efficiency can translate into big savings in development time and energy consumption.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>Smart speakers, watches, thermostats, pacemakers — it’s inevitable that neural networks will run on more and more heterogenous hardware.

A new study questions advances in metric learning.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Kevin Musgrave and researchers at Cornell Tech and Facebook AI re-examined hallmark results in models that learn to predict task-specific distance metrics, specifically networks designed to quantify the similarity between two images. They found <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08505?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">little evidence of progress</a>.<br><br><strong>Key insight: </strong>Researchers have explored metric learning by experimenting with factors like architectures, hyperparameters, and optimizers. But when those factors aren’t held constant, comparisons with earlier approaches can’t be apples-to-apples. Improved results often reflect advances in the surrounding components (such as hyperparameter tuning), not in the metric learning algorithm itself.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Models that assess similarity between images typically extract features and predict a distance between them. The distances may be learned through a metric loss function, while features are often extracted from pre-trained networks. The authors reviewed 12 of the most popular papers on this topic. They point out common causes of invalid comparisons and present a new approach that levels the playing field.</p><ul><li>Several papers compare a ResNet50 to a <a href=\"https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43022.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">GoogLeNet</a> trained using different methods. A ResNet50 is larger and outperforms a GoogLeNet on other image processing tasks, so it’s no surprise the ResNet50 performs better at metric learning.</li><li>Many researchers don’t use a validation set but still tune hyperparameters. Presumably, they chose hyperparameter values based on the models’ performance on test sets — a big no-no.</li><li>These two flaws, and a list of smaller mistakes, inspired the authors to propose a consistent <a href=\"https://github.com/KevinMusgrave/powerful-benchmarker?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">test bed</a> for metric learning research.
