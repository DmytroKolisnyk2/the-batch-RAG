The <em>Times</em> received the document from an employee who was disturbed by TikTok’s distribution of content that could encourage self-harm. The company confirmed its authenticity.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The company’s primary goal is to add daily active users. A flowchart (see above) indicates that the primary factors that determine daily active use are time spent with the app and repeated uses (“retention”), which in turn are driven largely by interactions such as likes and comments and video quality as determined by the creator’s rate of uploads and ability to make money from them. To that end, the recommender scores each video with respect to a given user and offers those with the highest scores.</p><ul><li>The ranking algorithm applies a formula that, in simplified form, goes like this: <em>Plike x Vlike + Pcomment x Vcomment + Eplaytime x Vplaytime + Pplay x Vplay</em>. The <em>Times</em> report didn't define its terms.</li><li>A machine learning model predicts whether a given user will like a given video, comment on it, spend a particular amount of time watching it, or play it at all. This model apparently supplies the variables marked P (for predicted) and E (for estimated). Those marked V could be the value of that activity; that is, how much the company values a given user liking, commenting, watching for a certain amount of time, or watching at all. Thus the formula appears to compute an estimated value of showing the video to the user.</li><li>The document suggests various ways in which TikTok can refine the recommendations. For instance, it might boost the rank of videos by producers whose works a user watched previously, on the theory that they’re more likely to engage with that producer’s output.</li><li>Conversely, in a bid to avoid boredom, it might penalize videos in categories that the user watched earlier the same day. It also penalizes videos that aim to achieve a high score by asking viewers explicitly to like them.</li><li>The document suggests that Douyin, Tiktok’s Chinese equivalent, relies on a similar recommender.</li></ul><p><strong>What they’re saying:</strong> “There seems to be some perception (by the media? or the public?) that they’ve cracked some magic code for recommendation, but most of what I’ve seen seems pretty normal.” — Julian McAuley, professor of computer science, University of California San Diego, quoted by <em>The New York Times</em>.<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> In July, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> attempted to understand TikTok’s recommender by <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/video/series/inside-tiktoks-highly-secretive-algorithm/investigation-how-tiktok-algorithm-figures-out-your-deepest-desires?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--UYZLx6XM2IeKQPWJcT6auDIIEC8KhOdG_2aWduWBDpZzfAmD-DzYofnd_BgIexMf-vy3-\" rel=\"noopener\">creating</a> over 100 automated accounts, each with a fake date of birth, IP address, and interests such as yoga, forestry, or extreme sports. TikTok homed in on most of the bots’ interests in less than two hours. By analyzing the videos recommended to each account, the reporters determined that the algorithm gave the heaviest weights to time spent watching a video, number of repeat viewings, and whether the video was paused during playback.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> TikTok has amassed over <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/1-billion-people-on-tiktok?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--UYZLx6XM2IeKQPWJcT6auDIIEC8KhOdG_2aWduWBDpZzfAmD-DzYofnd_BgIexMf-vy3-\" rel=\"noopener\">1 billion monthly users</a> since its founding in late 2016, and its recommender is an important part of the reason why. The secret sauce is clearly of interest to competitors and researchers, but as we learn more about social media’s worrisome social impacts — such as spreading misinformation, inciting violence, and degrading mental health — it becomes vital to understand the forces at play so we can minimize harms and maximize benefits.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Compared to platforms that deliver longer videos, TikTok’s short format enables it to show more clips per hour of engagement and thus to acquire more data about what a user does and doesn’t like. This makes it easier to customize a habit-forming feed for each audience member.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table class=\"hse-image-wrapper\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px !important;\"><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(59, 59, 59); word-break: break-word; text-align: center; padding: 5px 0px 10px; font-size: 0px;\"><img alt=\"GOPHER\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/5871640/hubfs/GOPHER.gif?upscale=true&amp;width=1200&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=GOPHER.gif\" width=\"600\" align=\"middle\" class=\"stretch-on-mobile\" style=\"outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width: 100%; font-size: 16px;\"></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"large-language-models-shrink\">Large Language Models Shrink</h1><p>DeepMind released three papers that push the boundaries — and examine the issues — of large language models.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> The UK-based subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/language-modelling-at-scale?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--UYZLx6XM2IeKQPWJcT6auDIIEC8KhOdG_2aWduWBDpZzfAmD-DzYofnd_BgIexMf-vy3-\" rel=\"noopener\">unveiled</a> a pair of transformer models that take different approaches to achieving state-of-the-art performance in a variety of language tasks.

New research aims to make CNN wise to such alterations.<br><br><strong>What's new:</strong> Jin Xu and colleagues at DeepMind <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05886?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--UYZLx6XM2IeKQPWJcT6auDIIEC8KhOdG_2aWduWBDpZzfAmD-DzYofnd_BgIexMf-vy3-\" rel=\"noopener\">modified the input to particular CNN layers</a> so translations and rotations of the input had the appropriate effect on the output.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Given an image and a translated version of it, a model that’s robust to translation, for instance, should produce nearly identical representations, the only difference being that one is offset by the amount of the translation. Typical CNNs use alternating layers of convolution and downsampling, specifically pooling. They aren’t robust to such transformations because shifting the image changes the relative position of pixels within the pooling window, producing disparate representations. Maintaining relative pixel positions can preserve the representation despite translation, rotation, and reflection.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors trained a five-layer convolutional encoder/decoder to reconstruct a dataset of <a href=\"https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--UYZLx6XM2IeKQPWJcT6auDIIEC8KhOdG_2aWduWBDpZzfAmD-DzYofnd_BgIexMf-vy3-\" rel=\"noopener\">images of 2D shapes against plain backgrounds</a>. In each training example, the shape was located at the upper left of the image and oriented at an angle between 0 and 90 degrees. The following steps describe how the network handled translation (it managed rotation and reflection in an analogous way):</p><ul><li>A convolution layer generated a representation of an image.</li><li>Before each downsampling layer, the network found the position in the pooling window of the largest value in the representation. Then it shifted the representation by that integer. Subsequently it performed pooling normally and concatenated the size of the shift to the representation.</li><li>The encoder repeated the convolution-and-pooling operation five times, collecting the shift amounts into a list. Thus the encoded representation had two parts: the typical convolutional representation and a list of translation amounts at each pooling layer.</li><li>The decoder alternated the convolution and upsampling layers five times to reconstruct the original input. The upsampling layers took into account the amount of translation before the corresponding downsampling layers before increasing the size of the representation.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> In qualitative tests, the authors’ modified CNN reconstructed test images outside of the training distribution, such as shapes located at the right side of the image or rotated more than 90 degrees, more accurately than a baseline model that used normal pooling. It reconstructed 3,200 images from the grayscale <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07747?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--UYZLx6XM2IeKQPWJcT6auDIIEC8KhOdG_2aWduWBDpZzfAmD-DzYofnd_BgIexMf-vy3-\" rel=\"noopener\">Fashion-MNIST</a> dataset of images of clothes and accessories with a mean reconstruction error of 0.0033, a decrease from the baseline architecture’s 0.0055.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The world is full of objects, placed willy-nilly. A CNN that can recognize items regardless of their orientation and position is likely to perform better on real-world images and other examples outside its training set.<br><br><strong>We're thinking:</strong> This model would recognize a picture of Andrew if his head were shifted to one side. But would it recognize him if he were wearing something other than a blue shirt?</p>","comment_id":"61ba5af3367176003b02b535","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-15-at-11.36.25-AM-copy.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2021-12-15T13:15:31.000-08:00","updated_at":"2022-10-05T15:07:56.000-07:00","published_at":"2021-12-15T12:00:00.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"We just wrapped up the Data-Centric AI Workshop at the NeurIPS 2021 conference.
