In reinforcement learning, DeepMind’s AlphaStar <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">achieved</a> Grandmaster status in the complex strategy game StarCraft II — able to beat 99.8 percent of human players — through tens of thousands of virtual years competing in a virtual league. OpenAI Five <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/openai-five/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">similarly</a> trained a team of five neural nets to best world champions of Dota 2. But those models learned in a virtual world to act in a virtual world. Other researchers transferred skills learned in simulations to the real world.</p><ul><li>OpenAI’s Dactyl robot hand spent the simulated equivalent of 13,000 years in virtual reality <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07113?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">developing</a> the dexterity required to manipulate a Rubik’s Cube puzzle. Then it applied those skills to a physical cube. It was able to solve the puzzle in 60 percent of tries when unscrambling the colored sides required 15 or fewer twists of the cube.

Marcus needled AI practitioners to reacquaint itself with the symbolist approach lest connectionism’s limitations precipitate a collapse in funding, or AI winter. The argument prompted sobering <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-ai-says-field-hit-wall/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">assessments </a>of AI’s future and culminated in a live <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/debate-yoshua-bengio-gary-marcus-live-streaming-tickets-81620778947?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">debate</a> on December 23 between Marcus and deep learning pioneer and Université de Montréal professor Yoshua Bengio.
