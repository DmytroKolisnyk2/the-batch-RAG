This advice will be seen as some of the worst career advice ever given. I disagree with the Turing Award and Nobel prize winner who wrote, “It is far more likely that the programming occupation will become extinct [...] than that it will become all-powerful. More and more, computers will program themselves.”​ Statements discouraging people from learning to code are harmful!</p><p>In the 1960s, when programming moved from punchcards (where a programmer had to laboriously make holes in physical cards to write code character by character) to keyboards with terminals, programming became easier. And that made it a better time than before to begin programming. Yet it was in this era that Nobel laureate Herb Simon wrote the words quoted in the first paragraph. Today’s arguments not to learn to code continue to echo his comment.</p><p>As coding becomes easier, more people should code, not fewer!</p><p>Over the past few decades, as programming has moved from assembly language to higher-level languages like C, from desktop to cloud, from raw text editors to IDEs to AI assisted coding where sometimes one barely even looks at the generated code (which some coders recently started to call vibe coding), it is getting easier with each step. (By the way, to learn more about AI assisted coding, check out our video-only short course, “<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/build-apps-with-windsurfs-ai-coding-agents/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3y3RXjUXVVnR-2W24Pwv0YfKeZMzD3pMv8YYZ-9CvFwDTMLGRGK4pRgeKyhGyMyH-4ZnT\" rel=\"noopener\">Build Apps with Windsurf’s AI Coding Agents</a>.”)</p><p>I wrote previously that I see tech-savvy people coordinating AI tools to move toward being&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-ai-can-make-you-a-10x-professional/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3y3RXjUXVVnR-2W24Pwv0YfKeZMzD3pMv8YYZ-9CvFwDTMLGRGK4pRgeKyhGyMyH-4ZnT\" rel=\"noopener\">10x professionals</a>&nbsp;— individuals who have 10 times the impact of the average person in their field.

My answer is: Learn about AI and take control of it, because one of the most important skills in the future will be the ability to tell a computer exactly what you want, so it can do that for you. Coding (or getting AI to code for you) is the best way to do that.</p><p>When I was working on the course&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/MW8Dpc7fxHxW4JZw5k1GrcYmW7jDgJ35t3v6lN35KTCK3qgyTW7Y8-PT6lZ3m2W5Mr7PQ6cbrj8W6wJ6fv80B47KW68DzfQ1lty8mW2CVHsR2ZyXtgN98Z_W0dL_71W5xtdB886dxN8W8-3Rz_63qJ-6W8tpk2p5h8dNNW8tXzLB7r7Fp4N251vz06TQ0SN2ZNYDQfhYTrW8vFw-N4xBwlLW60J8yK4Zd1xcW8ZBCDh5bVdBdW79FMNs5nV3SlW6V_pKp3pV_y9W1YcCVV81sh81W6kCb8X1qpD3nW1b0Bsh6tslhMW1Zd1vd6hmHQCW8dFKYM1hwk-mW5GKhhw7KV-VHW22Lmyq5y2lryW8x1gVs6JSr88W8CkYNJ2czZ4xW3QzLwg4d_7Skf69-Y3K04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Generative AI for Everyone</em></a>&nbsp;and needed to generate AI artwork for the background images, I worked with a collaborator who had studied art history and knew the language of art. He prompted Midjourney with terminology based on the historical style, palette, artist inspiration and so on — using the language of art — to get the result he wanted. I didn’t know this language, and my paltry attempts at prompting could not deliver as effective a result.</p><p>Similarly, scientists, analysts, marketers, recruiters, and people of a wide range of professions who understand the language of software through their knowledge of coding can tell an LLM or an AI-enabled IDE what they want much more precisely, and get much better results. As these tools continue to make coding easier, this is the best time yet to learn to code, to learn the language of software, and learn to make computers do exactly what you want them to do.</p><p>Keep building!</p><p>Andrew</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/data-analytics?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/03/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-03-11T092327.321.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Promo banner for: &quot;Data Analytics&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1890\" height=\"1063\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-03-11T092327.321.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-03-11T092327.321.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/03/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-03-11T092327.321.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/03/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-03-11T092327.321.png 1890w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Pre-enroll now for the new Data Analytics Professional Certificate!

In contrast, QwQ-32B skipped preliminary fine-tuning and applied RL in two stages, first optimizing for correct responses and then for readability.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;RL can dramatically boost LLMs’ reasoning abilities, but the order in which different behaviors are rewarded matters. Using RL in stages enabled the team to build a 32 billion parameter model — small enough to run locally on a consumer GPU — that rivals a much bigger mixture-of-experts model, bringing powerful reasoning models within reach for more developers.

This ruling reversed an earlier decision in 2023, when the same judge had allowed Ross Intelligence’s fair-use defense to proceed to trial. In the new ruling, he found that Ross Intelligence’s use failed to meet the definition of fair use in key respects. (A jury trial is scheduled to determine whether Thomson Reuters' copyright was in effect at the time of the infringement and other aspects of the case.)</p><ul><li>Ross Intelligence’s AI-powered service competed directly with Thomson Reuters, potentially undermining its market by offering a derivative product without licensing its works. Use in a competing commercial product undermines a key factor in fair use.</li><li>The judge found that Ross Intelligence’s use was commercial and not transformative, meaning it did not significantly alter or add new meaning to Thomson Reuters’ works — another key factor in fair use.
