I’m highly skeptical that any of today’s AI models are sentient. Some reporters, to their credit, also expressed skepticism. Still, I worry that widespread circulation of sensationalistic reports on this topic will mislead many people. (You'll find more about it in this issue of The Batch.)</em></p><p><em>The news does raise an interesting question: How would we know if an AI system were to become sentient?</em></p><p><em>As I discussed in an earlier <a href=\"https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-26/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">letter</a>, whether an AI system is sentient (able to feel) is a philosophical question rather than a scientific one. A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable. Scientific questions about AI include whether it can beat a human chess champion, accurately translate language, drive a car safely, or pass the Turing Test. These are testable questions.</em></p><p><em>On the other hand, we have no clear test for whether a system is sentient, conscious (aware of its internal state and external surroundings), or generally intelligent (able to reason across a wide variety of domains). These questions fall in the realm of philosophy instead of science.</em></p><p><em>Here are some examples of philosophical questions. Even though we haven't devised ways to quantify many of these terms, these questions are enduring and important:</em></p><ul><li><em>Is the nature of humankind good or evil?</em></li><li><em>What is the meaning of life?</em></li><li><em>Is a tree/insect/fish conscious?</em></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-15-at-12--1-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Microscope and Plato's head statue\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-15-at-12--1-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-15-at-12--1-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-15-at-12--1-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>By the same token, many important questions that arise in discussions about AI are philosophical:</em></p><ul><li><em>Can AI be sentient?

But if any group of scientists were to succeed in doing so, it would help put to rest some of the ongoing debate.</em><br><br><em>I fully support work toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Perhaps a future AGI system will be sentient and conscious, and perhaps not — I’m not sure.

Google put the engineer on administrative leave.<br><br><strong>Is there anybody in there?</strong> <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08239?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">LaMDA</a> is a family of transformer-based models, pretrained to reproduce 1.56 trillion words of dialog, that range in size from 2 billion to 137 billion parameters. Google previously <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/googles-lamda-will-enable-open-ended-voice-conversations-348729?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">discussed</a> plans to incorporate it into products like Search and Assistant.</p><ul><li>After pretraining, given a prompt, LaMDA generated a number of possible responses. The developers collected a set of conversations with LaMDA and hired people to rate how sensible, specific, interesting, and safe its responses were. Then they fine-tuned the model to generate those ratings at the end of each response. LaMDA replies with the highest-rated response. To further improve its factual output, they fine-tuned it to mimic the hired workers’ searches and, in such cases, direct an external system to search rather than return the response. Given the previous input and new search results, the model produces new output — which may be a new response or a further search.</li><li>Researchers in Google’s Responsible AI group tested chatbots based on LaMDA to determine their propensity for hate speech and other toxic behavior. The process persuaded researcher Blake Lemoine that the model possessed self-awareness and a sense of personhood. He transcribed nine conversations between the model and Google researchers and submitted an <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22058315-is-lamda-sentient-an-interview?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">argument</a> that LaMDA is sentient. In one transcript, a chatbot says it believes it’s a person, discusses its rights, and expresses a fear of being turned off.</li><li>Google placed Lemoine on administrative leave in early June for violating confidentiality by hiring a lawyer to defend LaMDA’s right to exist and speaking to a member of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee about what he regarded as ethical violations in Google’s treatment of the LaMDA. “Lemoine was told that there was no evidence that LaMDA was sentient (and lots of evidence against it),” a company spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">told</a> <em>The Washington Post</em>.</li><li>In a blog post, Lemoine <a href=\"https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/may-be-fired-soon-for-doing-ai-ethics-work-802d8c474e66?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">writes</a> that Google’s decision to discipline him follows a pattern of unfair treatment by the company towards its ethics researchers, charging that the company disregards the concerns of ethics researchers and punishes them for speaking up. He cites the company’s earlier dismissal of Ethical AI co-leads Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell.</li></ul><p><strong>What they’re saying:</strong> Many members of the AI community expressed skepticism of Lemoine’s claims via social media. Melanie Mitchell, professor at the Santa Fe Institute, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MelMitchell1/status/1535628390509686785?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--uw0fvAOLQ9anmiXzyque9jktSEbMSrtHmfjms1nvTqxZGaU4rms_8CoW723Ahw6Hm-mp6\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a>, “It's been known for forever that humans are predisposed to anthropomorphize even with only the shallowest of signals…Google engineers are human too, and not immune.”<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The propensity to anthropomorphize machines is so strong that it has a name: The Eliza Effect, which refers to a mid-1960s chatbot that persuaded some patients that it was a human psychotherapist. Beyond that, the urge to fall in love with one’s own handiwork is at least as old as the ancient Greek story of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pygmalion?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Pygmalion</a>, a fictional sculptor who fell in love with a statue he created. We must strive to strengthen our own good judgment even as we do the same for machines.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> We see no reason to believe that LaMDA may be sentient. While such episodes are a distraction from the important work of harnessing AI to solve serious, persistent problems (including machine sentience), they are a reminder to approach extraordinary claims with appropriate skepticism.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/06/TASER--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Yellow drone\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/TASER--1-.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/06/TASER--1-.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/06/TASER--1-.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"ethics-team-scuttles-taser-drone\">Ethics Team Scuttles Taser Drone</h1><p>A weaponized AI system intended to protect students has been grounded.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Axon, which makes law-enforcement equipment such as tasers and body cameras, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/06/taser-drone-school-shootings-clash/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">canceled</a> a plan to sell remote-controlled drones capable of firing electroshock darts to incapacitate attackers at schools, businesses, and other public places.

A human operator would decide when to fire its electroshock projectile.</p><ul><li>The company’s CEO Rick Smith estimated that 50 to 100 drones would equal the cost of a single armed security guard, he said in an Ask Me Anything <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v43uhv/i_am_rick_smith_the_ceo_founder_of_axon/ib2i0rz/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">session</a> on Reddit held on the day the ethics board members resigned.</li><li>In his book <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/End-Killing-Technologies-Humanitys-Problem/dp/1989025536?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">The End of Killing</a></em> and a <a href=\"https://www.flipsnack.com/endofkillingcomic/the-end-of-killing/full-view.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">graphic novel</a> of the same name, Smith explains that the drone would launch automatically when an AI-enabled microphone detected the sound of gunfire. In addition, the system would alert on-site security, administrators, and local law enforcement.</li><li>Nine members of Axon’s ethics board released a statement opposing the plan, saying it “has no realistic chance of solving the mass shooting problem” that has afflicted U.S. schools in recent decades. They criticized the drone’s surveillance capability in particular, stating that it “will harm communities of color and others who are overpoliced, and likely well beyond that.”</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Axon’s announcement came about a week after a gunman <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61573377?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">killed</a> 19 students and two teachers at an elementary school in Texas.

The opposition, which believes that gun-control measures violate rights guaranteed by the nation’s constitution, favors solutions like armed guards and surveillance — proposals that align with Axon’s canceled drone.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Technological countermeasures are appealing in the face of repeated attacks on schools, workplaces, hospitals, and other public spaces.

A neural simulator can optimize the shape itself.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers at DeepMind devised <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00728?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Differentiable Learned Simulators</a>, neural networks that learn to simulate physical processes, to help design surfaces that channel fluids in specific ways.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> A popular way to design an object with certain physical properties is to evolve it using a numerical simulator: sample candidate designs, test their properties, keep the best design, tweak it randomly, and repeat. Here’s a faster, nonrandom alternative: Given parameters that define an object’s shape as a two- or three-dimensional mesh, a differentiable model can compute how it should change to better perform a task. Then it can use that information to adjust the object’s shape directly.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Water and air can be modeled as systems of particles. The authors trained <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03409?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">MeshGraphNets</a>, a type of graph neural network, to reproduce a prebuilt simulator’s output. The networks were trained to simulate the flow of particles around various shapes by predicting the next state given the previous state. The MeshGraphNets’ nodes represented particles, and their edges connected nearby particles.</p><ul><li>They trained one network to simulate the flow of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.9405?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">water in two dimensions</a> and used it to optimize the shapes of containers and ramps. They trained another to simulate <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2786784.2786796?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--uw0fvAOLQ9anmiXzyque9jktSEbMSrtHmfjms1nvTqxZGaU4rms_8CoW723Ahw6Hm-mp6\" rel=\"noopener\">water in three dimensions</a> and used it to design surfaces that directed an incoming stream in certain directions. They trained the third on the output of an <a href=\"https://openfoam.org/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">aerodynamic solver</a> and used it to design an airfoil — a cross-section of a wing — to reduce drag.</li><li>Given a shape’s parameters, the trained networks predicted how the state would change over a set number of time steps by repeatedly predicting the next state from the current one. Then they evaluated the object based on a reward function. The reward functions for the 2D and 3D water tasks maximized the likelihood that particles would pass through a target region of simulated space. The reward function for the aerodynamic task minimized drag.</li><li>To optimize a shape, the authors repeatedly backpropagated gradients from the reward function through the network (without changing it) to the shape, updating its parameters.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Shapes designed using the authors’ approach outperformed those produced by the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-4321-0?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">cross-entropy method</a> (CEM), a technique that samples many designs and evolves them to maximize rewards. In the 2D water tasks, they achieved rewards 3.9 to 37.5 percent higher than shapes produced by CEM using the prebuilt simulator. In the aerodynamic task, they achieved results similar to those of a highly specialized <a href=\"https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.J058853?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">solver</a>, producing drag coefficients between 0.01898 and 0.01919 compared to DAFoam’s 0.01902 (lower is better).<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> It’s not uncommon to train a neural network to mimic the output of a computation-intensive physics simulator. Using such a neural simulator not to run simulations but to optimize inputs according to the simulation’s outcome — that’s a fresh idea.</p>","comment_id":"62aa448bbfe43f003d7093fa","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-15-at-12--1--1.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-06-15T13:43:55.000-07:00","updated_at":"2022-10-05T14:36:05.000-07:00","published_at":"2022-06-15T12:00:00.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"A Google Engineer recently announced he believes that a language model is sentient.
