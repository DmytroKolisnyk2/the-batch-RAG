Every piece of data relating to individual users was supposed to come through the data warehouse, and it was an intellectually challenging undertaking to store the data reliably and make it available to other teams, subject to security and privacy guardrails, so they could use it to derive insights.</p><p>I wish that, back then, I (and my whole team) had had access to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/data-engineering?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RaxAsQbUZVn4Byp0MKghpPLgvRTpegjDFKiplwAS5TN-U9RCZ5E69iSL5zH1ISvYtKp-7\" rel=\"noopener\">Data Engineering Professional Certificate</a>, a major new specialization we just launched on Coursera!</p><p>Data underlies all modern AI systems, and engineers who know how to build systems to store and serve it are in high demand.&nbsp;Today, far too many businesses struggle to build a robust data infrastructure, which leads to missed opportunities to create value with data analytics and AI. Additionally, AI’s rise is accelerating the demand for data engineers.</p><p>If you’re interested in learning these skills, please check out this four-course sequence, which is designed to make you job-ready as a data engineer.</p><p>The Data Engineering Professional Certificate is taught by Joe Reis, co-author of the best-selling book&nbsp;<em>Fundamentals of Data Engineering</em>, in collaboration with Amazon Web Services. (Disclosure: I serve on Amazon's board of directors.) When DeepLearning.AI decided to teach data engineering, I felt that Joe, who has helped many startups and big companies design their data architectures and thus has broad and deep experience in this field, would be the ideal instructor. He was the first person we reached out to, and I was thrilled that he agreed to work with us on this. I hope that you’ll be thrilled, too, taking this specialization!</p><p>While building AI systems and analyzing data are important skills, the data that we feed into these systems determines their performance. In this specialization, you’ll go through the whole data engineering lifecycle and learn how to generate, ingest, store, transform, and serve data. You’ll learn how to make necessary tradeoffs between speed, flexibility, security, scalability, and cost.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/09/unnamed--11--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Diagram of the data engineering cycle from generation to ingestion and transformation to analytics and machine learning.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/09/unnamed--11--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/09/unnamed--11--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/09/unnamed--11--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>If you’re a software engineer, this will give you a deeper understanding of data engineering so that you can build data applications. If you’re an aspiring or practicing data scientist or AI/machine learning engineer, you’ll learn skills that expand your scope to manage data in a more sophisticated way.&nbsp;For example, you’ll learn about DataOps to automate and monitor your data pipelines, and how to build “infrastructure as code” to programmatically define, deploy, and maintain your data infrastructure, as well as best practices for data-centric AI.</p><p>You’ll also hear 17 other industry leaders share their wisdom about effective data engineering. Bill Inmon, the father of data warehousing, shares fascinating stories about the evolution of the data warehouse, including how he wrote his first program as a student in 1965. Wes McKinney, creator of the Python pandas package (as in “import pandas as pd”), talks about how he designed this wildly popular package and shares best practices for data manipulation. These instructors will give you a mental framework for developing and deploying data systems.</p><p>Getting your data infrastructure right is a valuable foundational skill that will serve you well in whatever you do with AI or data analytics.

The models are available to paid ChatGPT users as well as API customers who have been onboard for more than 30 days and spent $1,000. o1-preview costs $15/$60 per million input/output tokens, significantly higher than GPT-4o’s price of $5/$15. o1-mini costs $3/$12 per million input/output tokens. OpenAI didn’t announce a release date for a finished o1 model.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;o1-preview is a preliminary release, and o1-mini is a faster preliminary version that’s particularly effective at coding. OpenAI published an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/o1-system-card.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RaxAsQbUZVn4Byp0MKghpPLgvRTpegjDFKiplwAS5TN-U9RCZ5E69iSL5zH1ISvYtKp-7\" rel=\"noopener\">o1 system card</a>&nbsp;but hasn’t disclosed details about the new models’ size, architecture, or training. Both models have an input context window of 128,000 tokens. They accept only text tokens, but OpenAI plans to support other media types in future versions.</p><ul><li>o1-preview and o1-mini were trained on data scraped from the web, open-source databases, and proprietary data supplied by partners and OpenAI. The reinforcement learning process rewarded the models for generating desired reasoning steps and for their alignment with human values, goals, and expectations.&nbsp;</li><li>The beta models process “reasoning tokens” that the company charges for as though they were output tokens although they’re invisible to users. The use of reasoning tokens makes the models slower and costlier to produce output than GPT-4o, but they deliver superior performance in tasks that benefit from step-by-step reasoning. OpenAI provides an example in which o1-preview deciphered enciphered text in which each letter is replaced by two letters that, according to alphabetical order, are equidistant from the intended letter. In other examples, it calculates the pH of a solution of ammonium fluoride and suggests a medical diagnosis based on symptoms that are present and absent.</li><li>o1-preview’s output is limited to around 32,768 tokens, including reasoning tokens, while o1-mini’s is capped at roughly 65,536. OpenAI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning?reasoning-prompt-examples=coding-planning&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RaxAsQbUZVn4Byp0MKghpPLgvRTpegjDFKiplwAS5TN-U9RCZ5E69iSL5zH1ISvYtKp-7\" rel=\"noopener\">recommends</a>&nbsp;budgeting 25,000 tokens for reasoning.</li><li>OpenAI keeps the chain of thought hidden to avoid exposing information that wasn’t requested. In addition, it doesn’t want users to try to control the model’s reasoning, and it doesn’t want competitors to see what’s going on behind the scenes. (Nonetheless, ChatGPT users can see a summary of steps that led to a given response)</li><li>OpenAI and third parties conducted safety evaluations, including testing for inappropriate outputs, race, gender, and age biases, and harmful chains of thought. o1-preview and o1-mini returned fewer hallucinations and showed more resistance to jailbreaking attacks than GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini. Both models show a higher risk than previous OpenAI models of helping to produce biological threats, but the risk is within the bounds of its safety policy.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:&nbsp;</strong>The actual o1 model — which remains unavailable — generally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RaxAsQbUZVn4Byp0MKghpPLgvRTpegjDFKiplwAS5TN-U9RCZ5E69iSL5zH1ISvYtKp-7\" rel=\"noopener\">outperforms</a>&nbsp;o1-preview, while both vastly outperform GPT-4o on math, science, and coding benchmarks.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>o1:</strong>&nbsp;The forthcoming model outperformed GPT-4o on 54 out of 57 MMLU subcategories that test knowledge in fields like elementary mathematics, U.S. history, and law. It achieved an Elo score of 1,673 on coding contests drawn from the website Codeforces (in which it was allowed 10 submissions for any given problem), putting it in the 89th percentile (human expert level). On the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12022?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RaxAsQbUZVn4Byp0MKghpPLgvRTpegjDFKiplwAS5TN-U9RCZ5E69iSL5zH1ISvYtKp-7\" rel=\"noopener\">GPQA</a>&nbsp;Diamond tests of graduate-level knowledge in biology, chemistry, and physics, it scored higher than PhD-level experts recruited by OpenAI. It correctly answered 74 percent of questions from the 2024 USA Math Olympiad qualifier.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>o1-preview:</strong>&nbsp;The preview version ranked in the 62nd percentile on Codeforces. Human evaluators preferred its output to that of GPT-4o in response to prompts that tested coding, data analysis, and math. (They preferred GPT-4o’s responses to prompts that requested “personal writing.”)</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:&nbsp;</strong>In recent months, Anthropic has been using the tag &lt;antThinking&gt; to generate thinking tokens that are hidden from users. However, OpenAI’s implementation in the o1 models takes this capability much further.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:&nbsp;</strong>The o1 models show that the combination of reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought reasoning can solve problems that large language models generally find challenging. They’re substantially more accurate in domains such as coding, math, and science that have low tolerance for error. However, the fact that the models hide their reasoning from users makes them less transparent and explainable than their predecessors and may make their outstanding performance less valuable in some applications.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Agentic workflows can significantly improve a system’s ability to reflect, reason, and iterate on its output. Training a model to take such steps directly in response to even general-purpose questions opens an exciting alternative path to better reasoning beyond simply scaling up model size.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/09/unnamed--9-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Llama 3.1 405B output speed versus price.

Researchers proposed a way to reduce this tendency and attendant risks to intellectual property and privacy.</p><p><strong>What’s new:&nbsp;</strong>Abhimanyu Hans and colleagues from University of Maryland introduced the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10209?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RaxAsQbUZVn4Byp0MKghpPLgvRTpegjDFKiplwAS5TN-U9RCZ5E69iSL5zH1ISvYtKp-7\" rel=\"noopener\">goldfish loss</a>, a modification of the next-token-prediction loss function typically used in large language models. The goldfish loss avoids memorization of long passages by masking some tokens during the loss computation.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;Certain passages may appear many times during training, either because the model takes multiple passes over data or because they’re duplicated in the training corpus. Randomly masking individual tokens from the loss computation doesn’t prevent a model from memorizing repeated passages because the model, over many repetitions, still sees every word and its place in the order. But masking a long passage the same way with every repetition ensures the model can’t memorize the passage regardless of the number of repetitions.</p><p><strong>How it works:&nbsp;</strong>The goldfish loss masks the current token from the loss computation based on previous tokens. &nbsp;A deterministic hashing function decides which tokens to mask effectively at random the first time it encounters a particular 13-token sequence, but identically if it encounters the same sequence again. At a high level, it masks a certain percentage of tokens, typically one in three or four. The authors compared the goldfish loss to the next-token-prediction loss function in two settings: one that mimicked a typical training process and one that made memorization more likely.</p><ul><li>For the typical training process, the authors trained&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02385?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RaxAsQbUZVn4Byp0MKghpPLgvRTpegjDFKiplwAS5TN-U9RCZ5E69iSL5zH1ISvYtKp-7\" rel=\"noopener\">TinyLLaMa-1.1B</a>&nbsp;for one epoch on a subset of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RaxAsQbUZVn4Byp0MKghpPLgvRTpegjDFKiplwAS5TN-U9RCZ5E69iSL5zH1ISvYtKp-7\" rel=\"noopener\">RedPajama</a>, a de-duplicated dataset of text scraped from the web.

Both measure memorization, so lower scores are better.</p><ul><li>In the typical setting, the model trained using the next-token-prediction loss memorized heavily, while the model trained with the goldfish loss memorized just a little bit.</li><li>In the setting that promoted memorization, the model trained using the next-token-prediction loss exactly matched 85 percent of the tokens in the Wikipedia articles and achieved 96 percent ROUGE-L. The model using the goldfish loss exactly matched 0 percent of the Wikipedia tokens and achieved 51 percent ROUGE-L.</li><li>Both models achieved similar performance on six common-sense reasoning and question answering tasks, indicating that the goldfish loss didn’t hinder the accuracy on those tasks.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:&nbsp;</strong>Businesses are worried about whether using LLMs<strong>&nbsp;</strong>poses risks to intellectual property rights and privacy. Techniques that address this concern without significantly impacting performance are welcome.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:&nbsp;</strong>Memorization also happens in models generating images. We look forward to research into using similar techniques in that domain.&nbsp;</p>","comment_id":"66eb514899961b0001f50db6","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/09/Untitled-design.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2024-09-18T15:16:40.000-07:00","updated_at":"2024-09-20T09:20:46.000-07:00","published_at":"2024-09-18T16:00:00.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"The
