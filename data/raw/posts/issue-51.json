(Apparently some of the organizers had taken <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/ai-for-everyone/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">AI for Everyone</a>.) Many attendees wanted to know how AI systems can be rolled out in a responsible and accountable way.</em></p><p><em>Consider the banking industry. Many regional banks are under tremendous competitive pressure. How well they assess risk directly affects their bottom line, so they turn to credit scoring systems from AI vendors. But if they don’t have the technical expertise to evaluate such models, a hasty rollout can lead to unintended consequences like unfairly charging higher interest rates on loans to minority groups.</em></p><p><em>For AI systems to enjoy smooth rollouts, we need to (a) make sure our systems perform well and pose minimal risk of unintended consequences and (b) build trust with customers, users, regulators, and the general public that these systems work as intended. These are hard problems. They require not just solving technical issues but also aligning technology with society’s values, and expectations.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Andrews20Letter-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Andrew Ng speaking at the National Intergovernmental Audit Forum about auditing AI systems\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><em>An important part of the solution is transparency. The open source software movement has taught us that transparency makes software better. And if making source code publicly available means that someone finds an embarrassing security bug, so be it! At least it gets fixed.</em></p><p><em>With the rise of AI, we should similarly welcome third-party assistance, such as allowing independent parties to perform audits according to a well established procedure. That way, we can identify problems and fix them quickly and efficiently.</em></p><p><em>After my presentation, the moderator asked me how auditors can avoid getting into adversarial relationships with AI vendors. Instead, we need to build collaborative relationships. By collaborating, we can help make sure the criteria used to judge our systems is reasonable and well specified. For instance, what are the protected groups we need to make sure our systems aren’t biased against? We can also better avoid “gotcha” situations in which our systems are assessed according to arbitrary, after-the-fact criteria.</em></p><p><em>The AI community has a lot of work to do to ensure that our systems are fair, accountable, and reliable. For example, Credo AI (disclosure: a portfolio company of AI Fund, a sister organization to deeplearning.ai) is building tools that help audit and govern AI systems. Efforts like this can make a difference in designing and deploying AI systems that benefit all people.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h2 id=\"news\"><strong>News</strong></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-optimize2015.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Man with prosthetic leg walking\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"ai-steps-up\">AI Steps Up</h3><p>A prosthetic leg that learns from the user’s motion could help amputees walk more naturally.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers from the University of Utah <a href=\"https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/5/44/eaba6635?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=ae7f485139d8b5ed0983aa3c9a294fa3ebfd558e-1595808620-0-AToEO56027Xyn-8QW2_FtJd1lzeugSlF_B0uYj6dXgiQ1zGlfjF8eM2aJpB7xqDxU5FLgKzu81pquDJMNs1N31vjU25KItJSKjcF5a33WcSuA6gBKaBL331QNgiVNtPglUhkgBOCKMgGN59SogmD7KKVG27s7e1oG5VE4RL7DXZkK_1l9E_Jt7RzkjnD_2SsRBnfNlz69PJRZoT5EwSWewUA5__1Cn08qxsq276L7fex9WMxhToWq9ZbNPWIpq6wgsObikU1C7yZ6PX8IT0FNlXLGnCEo-VFvoCYo9sLogQ1&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">designed</a> a robotic leg that uses machine learning to generate a human-like stride.

Sensors in the user’s hip feed data a thousand times per second into a processing unit located in the unit’s calf. For instance, the way a user rotates their hip might tell the leg to tuck its knee to avoid tripping over an obstacle.</p><ul><li>A finite state machine (a logic-based controller) determines when and how to flex the knee based on angles of the ankle and thigh and the weight on the prosthetic foot.</li><li>A second model called the minimum-jerk planner kicks in when the angle and speed of the artificial limb reach a certain point.

The problem can fade with enough training data, but it’s pervasive where training data is scarce. Overfitting limited data contributes to overconfidence, so combining deep learning with probabilistic methods, which are less prone to overfitting, might alleviate overconfidence.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> PNCA is a probabilistic version of <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/nca.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Neighborhood Component Analysis</a>. NCA is a supervised learning method that trains neural nets to extract features that cluster examples of the same class. NCA determines the class of novel input by computing the distance between training data features and input features. It takes the softmax of the distances to obtain the probability that each training example belongs to the same class of the novel input. Practically speaking, NCA is a classification network with fixed output layer weights, but not size, given by the distance function.</p><ul><li>PNCA borrows ideas from deep Bayesian networks, which interpret inputs, weights, extracted features, neighborhoods, and class predictions as samples of probability distributions. The use of probability distributions allows PNCA to sharpen its confidence by computing the probability that a particular classification would occur with the provided input.</li><li>The technique estimates the distribution of predicted classes by sampling weights from the weight distribution. Every pair of sampled weights and training examples determines a distinct extracted feature, so running the usual NCA on every pair yields a classification that depends on the weight distribution.</li><li>PNCA determines the entire weight distribution by maintaining a sample of weights. Then it trains the sample of weights to generate a sample of predictions to match the training data, updating the weights to minimize the NCA loss.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers trained PNCA on a <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/bachrr/covid-chest-xray?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Kaggle dataset</a> of chest x-rays showing Covid-19, and tested it on <a href=\"https://github.com/agchung/Actualmed-COVID-chestxray-dataset?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Covid-V2</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Cats and Dogs dataset</a>. PNCA performed with similar accuracy to other deep learning approaches on Covid-V2, while incorrectly classifying 1,000 cats and dogs out of 25,000 as Covid-19 with high confidence. This may seem like poor performance, but the same architecture with a standard supervised learning objective mistook around 2500 cats and dogs as Covid-19 chest x-rays.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Deep learning’s overconfidence and data hunger are limitations to their practical deployment.
