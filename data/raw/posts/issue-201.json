While it’s critically important not to let hypothetical scenarios distract us from addressing realistic issues, I’d like to talk about a long-term risk that I think is realistic and has received little attention: If AI becomes cheaper and better than many people at doing most of the work they can do, swaths of humanity will no longer contribute economic value. I worry that this could lead to a dimming of human rights.</em></p><p><em>We’ve already seen that countries where many people contribute little economic value have some of the worst records of upholding fundamental human rights like free expression, education, privacy, and freedom from mistreatment by authorities. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9sb00_4vxeZV9IwatG6RjF9THyqdWuQ47paEA_y055Eku8IYnLnfILzB5BWaMHlRPQipHJ\" rel=\"noopener\">resource curse</a> is the observation that countries with ample natural resources, such as fossil fuels, can become less democratic than otherwise similar countries that have fewer natural resources. <a href=\"https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/578321468762592831/natural-resources-and-violent-conflict-options-and-actions?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9sb00_4vxeZV9IwatG6RjF9THyqdWuQ47paEA_y055Eku8IYnLnfILzB5BWaMHlRPQipHJ\" rel=\"noopener\">According to the World Bank</a>,“developing countries face substantially higher risks of violent conflict and poor governance if [they are] highly dependent on primary commodities.”</em></p><p><em>A ruler (perhaps dictator) of an oil-rich country, for instance, can hire foreign contractors to extract the oil, sell it, and use the funds to hire security forces to stay in power. Consequently, most of the local population wouldn’t generate much economic value, and the ruler would have little incentive to make sure the population thrived through education, safety, and civil rights.</em></p><p><em>What would happen if, a few decades from now, AI systems reach a level of intelligence that disempowers large swaths of people from contributing much economic value? I worry that, if many people become unimportant to the economy, and if relatively few people have access to AI systems that could generate economic value, the incentive to take care of people — particularly in less democratic countries — will wane.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--10--1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"674\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--10--1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--10--1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--10--1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Marc Andreessen recently <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2023/06/06/ai-will-save-the-world/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9sb00_4vxeZV9IwatG6RjF9THyqdWuQ47paEA_y055Eku8IYnLnfILzB5BWaMHlRPQipHJ\" rel=\"noopener\">pointed out</a> that Tesla, having created a good car, has an incentive to sell it to as many people as possible.

If AI systems advance to the point where most people no longer can create enough value to justify a minimum wage (around $15 per hour in many places in the U.S.), many people will need to find a new sense of purpose. Worse, in some countries, the ruling class will decide that, because the population is no longer important for production, people are no longer important.</em></p><p><em>What can we do about this? I’m not sure, but I think our best bet is to work quickly to democratize access to AI by (i) reducing the cost of tools and (ii) training as many people as possible to understand them. This will increase the odds that people have the skills they need to keep creating value. It will also ensure that citizens understand AI well enough to steer their societies toward a future that’s good for everyone.</em></p><p><em>Keep working to make the world better for everyone!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/KHANMIGO.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"335\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/KHANMIGO.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"taught-by-a-bot\">Taught by a Bot</h1><p>While some schools resist their students’ use of chatbots, others are inviting them into the classroom.</p><p><strong>What’s new: </strong>Some primary and secondary schools in the United States are testing an automated tutor built by online educator Khan Academy, <em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/business/khan-ai-gpt-tutoring-bot.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9sb00_4vxeZV9IwatG6RjF9THyqdWuQ47paEA_y055Eku8IYnLnfILzB5BWaMHlRPQipHJ\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>.

Big players are already using the technology to build more elaborate virtual worlds, and many smaller studios will benefit from lower production costs.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/PAELLA--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/PAELLA--1-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"like-diffusion-but-faster\">Like Diffusion but Faster</h1><p>The ability to generate realistic images without waiting would unlock applications from engineering to entertainment and beyond. New work takes a step in that direction.</p><p><strong>What’s new: </strong>Dominic Rampas and colleagues at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt and Wand Technologies released <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07292?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9sb00_4vxeZV9IwatG6RjF9THyqdWuQ47paEA_y055Eku8IYnLnfILzB5BWaMHlRPQipHJ\" rel=\"noopener\">Paella</a>, a system that uses a process similar to diffusion to produce Stable Diffusion-quality images much more quickly.</p><p><strong>Key insight: </strong>An image generator’s speed depends on the number of steps it must take to produce an image: The fewer the steps, the speedier the generator. A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05233?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9sb00_4vxeZV9IwatG6RjF9THyqdWuQ47paEA_y055Eku8IYnLnfILzB5BWaMHlRPQipHJ\" rel=\"noopener\">diffusion model</a> learns to remove varying amounts of noise from each training example; at inference, given pure noise, it produces an image by subtracting noise iteratively over a few hundred steps. A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9sb00_4vxeZV9IwatG6RjF9THyqdWuQ47paEA_y055Eku8IYnLnfILzB5BWaMHlRPQipHJ\" rel=\"noopener\">latent diffusion model</a> reduces the number of steps to around a hundred by removing noise from a vector that represents the image rather than the image itself. Instead of a vector, using a selection of tokens from a predefined list makes it possible to do the same job in still fewer steps.</p><p><strong>How it works: </strong>Like a diffusion model, Paella learned to remove varying amounts of noise from tokens that represented an image and then produced a new image from noisy tokens. It was trained on 600 million image-text pairs from <a href=\"https://laion.ai/blog/laion-aesthetics/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9sb00_4vxeZV9IwatG6RjF9THyqdWuQ47paEA_y055Eku8IYnLnfILzB5BWaMHlRPQipHJ\" rel=\"noopener\">LAION-Aesthetics</a>.</p><ul><li>Given an image of 256x256 pixels, a pretrained <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09841?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9sb00_4vxeZV9IwatG6RjF9THyqdWuQ47paEA_y055Eku8IYnLnfILzB5BWaMHlRPQipHJ\" rel=\"noopener\">encoder-decoder</a> based on a convolutional neural network represented the image using 256 tokens selected from 8,192 tokens it had learned during pretraining.</li><li>The authors replaced a random fraction of the tokens with tokens chosen from the list at random.

Given the tokens, the decoder generated an image.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors evaluated Paella (573 million parameters) according to Fréchet inception distance (FID), which measures the difference between the distributions of original and generated images (lower is better). Paella achieved 26.7 FID on <a href=\"https://cocodataset.org/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9sb00_4vxeZV9IwatG6RjF9THyqdWuQ47paEA_y055Eku8IYnLnfILzB5BWaMHlRPQipHJ\" rel=\"noopener\">MS-COCO</a>.

Running on an Nvidia A100 GPU, Paella took 0.5 seconds to produce a 256x256-pixel image in eight steps, while Stable Diffusion took 3.2 seconds. (The authors reported FID for 12 steps but speed for eight steps.)</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Efforts to accelerate diffusion have focused on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1598131202044866560?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9sb00_4vxeZV9IwatG6RjF9THyqdWuQ47paEA_y055Eku8IYnLnfILzB5BWaMHlRPQipHJ\" rel=\"noopener\">distilling models such as Stable Diffusion</a>. Instead, the authors rethought the architecture to reduce the number of diffusion steps.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking: </strong>The authors trained Paella on 64 Nvidia A100s for two weeks using computation supplied Stability AI, the firm behind Stable Diffusion. It’s great to see such partnerships between academia and industry that give academic researchers access to computation.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong>FBI warns about deepfakes</strong><br>The agency has seen a surge in reports of extortion and harassment cases involving AI-generated nudes and is urging the public to post online content with caution.
