Once trained, such models can generate, on demand, images in a given artist’s style or code that executes particular tasks.</em></p><p><em>The lawsuits will answer the question of whether using publicly available data to train generative models is legal, but I see an even more important question: Is it fair? If society has a point of view on what is fair, we can work to make laws that reflect this.</em></p><p><em>To be clear, this issue is much bigger than generative AI. The fundamental question is whether AI systems should be allowed to learn from data that’s freely available to anyone with an internet connection. But the focus right now is on models that generate images and code.</em></p><p><em>Today, we routinely advise students of computer programming to read — and perhaps contribute to — open source code. Reading open source no doubt inspires individuals to write better code. No one questions whether this is fair. After all, it’s how people learn. Is it fair for a computer to do the same?</em></p><p><em>The last time I visited the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, California, I saw aspiring artists sitting on the floor and copying masterpieces on their own canvases. Copying the masters is an accepted part of learning to be an artist. By copying many paintings, students develop their own style. Artists also routinely look at other works for inspiration. Even the masters whose works are studied today learned from their predecessors. Is it fair for an AI system, similarly, to learn from paintings created by humans?</em></p><p><em>Of course, there are important differences between human learning and machine learning that bear on fairness. A machine learning model can read far more code and study far more images than a human can. It can also generate far more code or images, far more quickly and cheaply, than even the most skilled human.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--1--1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Artist copying the painting called The Dance Lesson by Edward Degas at the National Gallery Museum \" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--1--1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--1--1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--1--1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>These differences raise serious issues for artists, coders, and society at large:</em></p><ul><li><em>Production of creative works by a machine may devalue the work of human creators. </em></li><li><em>Generative models can reproduce the personal style of artists whose work they were trained on without compensating those artists.</em></li><li><em>Such models may have been trained on proprietary data that was not intended to be available on the internet (such as private images that were stolen or leaked).</em></li></ul><p><em>On the other hand, generative models have tremendous potential value. They’re helping people who are not skilled artists to create beautiful works, spurring artists to collaborate with computers in new ways, and automating workaday tasks so humans can focus on higher-level creativity. Furthermore, advances in AI build upon one another, and progress in generative AI brings progress in other areas as well.</em></p><p><em>The upshot is that we need to make difficult tradeoffs between enabling technological progress and respecting the desire to protect creators’ livelihoods. Thoughtful regulation can play an important role. One can imagine potential regulatory frameworks such as:</em></p><ul><li><em>Establishing a consistent way for creators to opt out</em></li><li><em>Mandating compensation for artists when AI systems use their data</em></li><li><em>Allocating public funding to artists (like using tax dollars to fund public media such as the BBC) </em></li><li><em>Setting a time limit, like copyright, after which creative works are available for AI training</em></li></ul><p><em>What a society views as fair can change. In the United States, once it was considered fair that only certain men could vote. When society’s view on this changed, we changed the rules.</em></p><p><em>Society currently has divergent views on what is fair for AI to do. Given the bounty offered by generative AI (and other AI systems), and acknowledging the need to make sure that creators are treated fairly, I hope we find a path forward that allows AI to continue to develop quickly for the benefit of all.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p></p><h1 id=\"news\">News</h1><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/LEGALGEN_v3.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/LEGALGEN_v3.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/LEGALGEN_v3.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/LEGALGEN_v3.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"generative-ai-on-trial\">Generative AI on Trial</h1><p>Models that generate text and images are raising thorny questions about the ownership of both their training data and their output.</p><p><strong>What’s new: </strong>The companies that provide popular tools for generating text and images are fighting a barrage of lawsuits. <em>TechCrunch</em> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/27/the-current-legal-cases-against-generative-ai-are-just-the-beginning/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_239XfoepLShu0l_Cvt9lVtM8H_jja_ePWwnNg-GtuRVbx2Nxl_NkfhqK4TlMpPq1ysqbR\" rel=\"noopener\">surveyed</a> the docket.</p><p><strong>Legal actions: </strong>Three lawsuits are in progress:</p><ul><li>A group of artists filed a class-action lawsuit in a United States court against Stability AI and Midjourney, companies that provide image generators, and DeviantArt, an online community that <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/generative-ai-from-deviantart-creates-controversy/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">hosts</a> its own image generator.

Listeners judged which clip — including the music in the dataset, which was produced by professional musicians — best matched a given caption. They judged MusicLM to have created the best match 30.0 percent of the time, Riffusion 15.2 percent of the time, and Mubert 9.3 percent of the time. They judged the ground-truth, human-created music to be the best fit 45.4 percent of the time.<br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> The listeners didn’t evaluate the generated clips based on how musically satisfying they were, just how well they matched the corresponding text. <br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Rather than relying on a single embedding, the authors combined three embeddings that represent an audio clip with increasing degrees of specificity. This approach, which is analogous to a human writer’s tendency to start with a concept, sketch an outline, and fill in the words, may be useful in other applications that require a computer to generate detailed, dynamic, long-form output.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> MusicLM’s output sounds more coherent than that of previous music generators, but it’s hard to judge musical values that unfold over time from brief clips. That said, its shows an impressive ability to interpret the diverse emotional language found in descriptions of painter Jacques-Louis David’s triumphant “Napoleon Crossing the Alps” and Edvard Munch’s harrowing “The Scream.”</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/TRUSTWORTHY-2_1200px--1-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Excerpts from NIST AI Risk Management Framework\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/TRUSTWORTHY-2_1200px--1-.gif 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/TRUSTWORTHY-2_1200px--1-.gif 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/TRUSTWORTHY-2_1200px--1-.gif 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"guidelines-for-managing-ai-risk\">Guidelines for Managing AI Risk</h1><p>The United States government published guidelines designed to help organizations limit harm from AI.</p><p><strong>What's new: </strong>The National Institute for Standards and Technology, which recommends technological standards in a variety of industries, <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/01/nist-risk-management-framework-aims-improve-trustworthiness-artificial?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_239XfoepLShu0l_Cvt9lVtM8H_jja_ePWwnNg-GtuRVbx2Nxl_NkfhqK4TlMpPq1ysqbR\" rel=\"noopener\">released</a> the initial version of its AI Risk Management Framework.</p><p><strong>What it says: </strong>The <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_239XfoepLShu0l_Cvt9lVtM8H_jja_ePWwnNg-GtuRVbx2Nxl_NkfhqK4TlMpPq1ysqbR\" rel=\"noopener\">framework</a> outlines principles for defining classes of potential harm, building trustworthy systems, and defending against AI-related risks as they emerge.</p><ul><li>Broad categories of AI-related risk include harm to people (by, say, causing medical distress or undermining civil liberties), harm to organizations (such as security breach or financial loss), and harm to ecosystems (both natural and artificial; for example, global financial networks).</li><li>Trustworthy AI systems are validated, privacy-enhanced, secure, explainable, fair, and accountable. Validated AI systems are accurate, reliable, and generalized to data and settings beyond their training. Privacy-enhanced systems protect the anonymity and confidentiality of people and their data.</li><li>Organizations can manage emerging capabilities by mapping risks that arise from a system’s intended uses, measuring risks, handling risks based on their projected impact, and, above all, cultivating a culture of transparency around mitigating risk.</li><li>NIST plans to evaluate the framework on an ongoing basis and will release an update in a few months.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news: </strong>NIST’s framework, created in response to a 2021 order from Congress, incorporates feedback from over 240 organizations.

NIST’s effort marks a step away from this jigsaw-puzzle approach and toward guidelines that have broad support and thus are more likely to be implemented.</p><p><strong>We're thinking: </strong>A framework like this is necessarily general, and different organizations will implement it very differently. For example, reliability in healthcare is very different from reliability in an app that customizes selfies, leading to different approaches to monitoring AI systems. It will take disciplined effort to translate these high-level ideas into specific practices — but it’s likely to head off tremendous trouble down the line.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong>Students weighed in on the use of ChatGPT in education </strong><br>High schoolers gave their opinions on the AI-powered chatbot that has educators divided.
