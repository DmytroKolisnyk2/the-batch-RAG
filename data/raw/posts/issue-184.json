Just as pictures of people’s perfect lives in the media aren’t representative, pictures of AI developers’ postings of their amazing projects also aren’t representative.</em></p><p><em>I’m here to say: Judge your projects according to your own standard, and don’t let the shiny objects make you doubt the worth of your work!</em></p><p><em>Over the years, I’ve occasionally felt this way, too, and wondered if I was working on a fruitful direction. A few years ago, when reinforcement learning (RL) made progress on Atari games, Alpha Go was in the headlines, and RL videos using OpenAI Gym circulated on social media, I was still focused on supervised learning. Part of me wondered if I was missing out. It certainly did not help when friends kept asking me about the cool RL work they read about in the news. Fortunately, I ignored the feeling that the grass might be greener on the other side and stuck to what I was excited about.</em></p><p><em>AI develops so quickly that waves of new ideas keep coming: quantum AI, self-supervised learning, transformers, diffusion models, large language models, and on and on. Some, like quantum AI, have had essentially no impact in applications so far. Others have already had a huge impact. Because our field evolves, it is important to keep learning and ride the waves of change. For the record, I think large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT (and, to a significant but lesser extent, diffusion models, best known for generating images) will have a transformative impact on AI, but they are far from the only things that will be important.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--2--1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Cellphone displaying an Instagram post with a picture of a robot doing yoga by the sunset\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--2--1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--2--1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg--2--1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Someone else’s sculpted physique does not take away from your beauty.

Projects of all shapes and sizes can be wonderful, and what’s buzzy today is only one of the many things that will prove valuable in the future.</em></p><p><em>I'm not advising you to ignore the news. Paying attention to new developments in AI not only helps you stay on top of the field but also can inspire you. Being inspired by Instagram is fine, but changing your life because of FOMO is less helpful.</em></p><p><em>So, if what you’re working on makes sense to you, maintain your faith and keep going!

Google Search is the undisputed leader, responsible for <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">93 percent</a> of all search-driven traffic according to StatCounter.</p><ul><li>The upgrades will take advantage of in-house models including the <a href=\"https://imagen.research.google/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Imagen</a> image generator, <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">LaMDA</a> conversation generator, <a href=\"https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">MusicLM</a> music generator, and <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">PaLM</a> large language model.</li><li>Google <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1622673775182626818?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">showed off</a> output from Bard, a chatbot powered by LaMDA.

The company did not say when the new capabilities would become available. Bing, the longstanding underdog of search, accounts for 3 percent of search-driven traffic.</p><ul><li>Bing as well as Microsoft’s Edge web browser, and Teams conferencing app will take advantage of a chatbot apparently code-named Sydney. The system will respond to conversational queries, summarize answers from multiple web pages, and generate text for emails, essays, advice, and so on.  A layer called Prometheus is intended to filter out incorrect or inappropriate results.</li><li>Kevin Liu, a computer science student at Stanford, prompted Sydney to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kliu128/status/1623472922374574080?s=20&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">reveal</a> its behind-the-scenes guidelines. They include directions to make responses “informative, visual, logical, and actionable” as well as “positive, interesting, entertaining, and engaging.” They direct the system to avoid answers that are “vague, controversial, or off-topic,” and present them with logic that is “rigorous, intelligent, and defensible.” It must search the web — up to three times per conversational turn — whenever a user seeks information. And so on.</li><li>While Google was caught unwittingly touting AI-generated falsehoods, Microsoft nearly got away with it. Days after the preview, AI researcher Dmitri Brereton <a href=\"https://dkb.blog/p/bing-ai-cant-be-trusted?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">detailed</a> several similar mistakes in the new Bing’s output. For instance, when asked to summarize earnings reports, it fabricated numbers. When asked to recommend night spots in Mexico City, it named nonexistent bars.</li></ul><p><strong>Baidu’s play:</strong> Baidu <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/07/baidu-shares-leaps-as-it-reveals-plan-for-chatgpt-style-ernie-bot.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> its own chatbot, Wenxin Yiyan, based on <a href=\"http://research.baidu.com/Blog/index-view?id=165&ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ERNIE</a>. The company expects to complete internal testing in March and deploy the system soon afterward. Baidu manages 65 percent of China’s search-driven traffic but less than 1 percent worldwide.</p><p><strong>Business hitches: </strong>Search engines make money by serving ads that users may view or click. If chatbots provide satisfying information, users may stop there, depriving the search provider of revenue. Microsoft’s Chief Marketing Officer Yusuf Mehdi <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/02/08/the-new-bing-is-out-a-microsoft-exec-weighs-in-on-how-it-will-make-money/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> <em>Fortune</em> the optimal way to present ads in a chatbot interface remains unknown.</p><p><strong>Yes, but: </strong>Numerous caveats further dampen the chatbot hype.</p><ul><li>Large language models are notoriously prone to generating falsehoods. Ruochen Zhao, a student of natural language processing at Nanyang Technological University, wrote a detailed <a href=\"https://dev.to/ruochenzhao3/can-chatgpt-like-generative-models-guarantee-factual-accuracy-on-the-mistakes-of-microsofts-new-bing-111b?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">analysis</a> of factual errors demonstrated by Google’s and Microsoft’s systems.</li><li>Large language models require much more computation than existing search algorithms. The cost of enhancing Google Search with ChatGPT output would approach $36 billion a year, the hardware newsletter <em>Semianalysis</em> <a href=\"https://www.semianalysis.com//p/the-inference-cost-of-search-disruption?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">estimates</a>. That’s roughly 65 percent of Google Search’s annual profit.</li><li>Generated text may face stiff regulation in some countries. In January, China began to <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/chinas-new-law-limits-ai-generated-media/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">enforce</a> new restrictions on synthetic media.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Google’s search engine propelled the company to the pinnacle of tech, and it hasn’t faced a serious challenge in nearly two decades. For the competitors, huge money is at stake — Microsoft recently <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/events/FY-2023/AI-Powered-Bing-Edge-Conf.aspx?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> its shareholders that every additional percentage of market share for Bing translates into $2 billion in revenue. For users, the utility and integrity of the web hangs in the balance.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> The future of search depends on tomorrow’s technology as well as today’s. While current large language models have a problem with factual accuracy, outfitting text generation with document retrieval offers a pathway to significant improvement. It’s also likely that the cost of serving generated text will fall significantly over time. Thus the technology’s potential to disrupt the search business is likely to continue to grow as it matures.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/unnamed--37-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Synthetic avatar created using the Synthesia demo \" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/unnamed--37-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"news-you-can-misuse\">News You Can Misuse</h1><p>Political forces used a commercial AI service to generate deepfaked propaganda.</p><p><strong>What’s new: </strong>Videos have appeared on social media that show AI-generated characters speaking against the United States or in favor of foreign governments, <em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/technology/artificial-intelligence-training-deepfake.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>.

A new paper identifies similar training examples, even if they’re not labeled.<br><br><strong>What’s new: </strong>Ben Sorscher, Robert Geirhos, and collaborators at Stanford University, University of Tübingen, and Meta proposed an unsupervised <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14486?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">method</a> for pruning training data without compromising model performance.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong>  A subset of a training dataset that can train a model to perform on par with training on the full corpus is known as a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08707?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">coreset</a>.  Previous approaches to selecting a coreset require labeled data. Such methods often train <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05922?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">many classification models</a>, study their output, and identify examples that are similar based on how many of the models classified them correctly. Clustering offers an unsupervised alternative that enables a pretrained model to find similar examples in unlabeled data without fine-tuning.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors trained and tested separate ResNets on various pruned versions of datasets both large (<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5206848?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ImageNet</a>, 1.2 million examples) and small (<a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">CIFAR-10</a>, 60,000 examples). They processed the datasets as follows:</p><ul><li>A self-supervised, pretrained <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09882?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">SWaV</a> produced a representation of each example.</li><li>K-means clustering grouped the representations.</li><li>The authors considered an example to be more similar to others (and thus easier to classify correctly) if it was closer to a cluster’s center, and less similar (harder to classify and thus more valuable to training) if it was further away.</li><li>They pruned a percentage of more-similar examples, a percentage of less-similar examples, or a random selection.</li></ul><p><strong>Results: </strong>Tests confirmed the authors’ theory that the optimal pruning strategy depends on dataset size. Pruning CIFAR-10, a ResNet performed better when the authors removed a portion of the most-similar examples than when they removed least-similar examples, up to 70 percent of the entire dataset. In contrast, starting with 10,000 random CIFAR-10 examples, the model achieved better performance when the authors removed any portion of least-similar examples than when they removed the same portion of most-similar examples. On ImageNet, their approach performed close to a state-of-the-art method called <a href=\"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/1e14bfe2714193e7af5abc64ecbd6b46-Abstract.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">memorization</a>, which requires labels. For instance, a ResNet trained on a subset of ImageNet that was missing the most-similar 30 percent of examples achieved 89.4 percent Top-5 accuracy, while using memorization to remove the same percentage of examples yielded nearly the same result. A ResNet trained on a subset of ImageNet that was missing the most-similar 20 percent of examples achieved 90.8 Top-5 accuracy, equal to a ResNet trained on ImageNet pruned to the same degree via memorization and a ResNet trained on ImageNet without pruning.<br><br><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The authors’ method can cut processing costs during training. If you eliminate examples before hiring people to label the data, it can save labor costs as well.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> By identifying overrepresented portions of the data distribution, data pruning methods like this can also help identify biases during training.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\">Data Points</h1><p><strong>Spotify founder announced an AI-powered body scanner focused on preventive health</strong><br>Neko Health, the new healthtech Swedish company co-founded by Daniel Ek, plans to offer non-invasive full-body scans that use AI to analyze data points on skin, heart function, and more.
