(3) It passed the updated embeddings through a convolutional neural network to produce new weights for the input architectures.</li><li>Prior <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1lma24tPB&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9MFARbq-QVJMvbQh6l8Hg4rKUTlPF1wO3tijIBwqvjkIv0NuknMDTyxFrLowaNhxM7e9D6\" rel=\"noopener\">work</a> found that models produced by hypernetworks generate representations whose values tend to be either very high or very low. GHN-2 normalized, or rescaled, the weights to moderate this effect.</li><li>Given a batch of network architectures and a set of images from CIFAR-10 or ImageNet during training, GHN-2 assigned weights in a way that minimized the difference between the networks’ predicted classes and the actual classes.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Architectures similar to those in the training set generally performed better using parameter values generated by GHN-2 than GHN-1. So did architectures that were wider, deeper, or more dense than those in the training set. Parameter values generated by GHN-2 yielded average CIFAR-10 accuracy of 66.9 percent versus GHN-1’s 51.4 percent. While GHN-2 outperformed GHN-1 on ImageNet, neither model produced great parameter values for that task. For instance, architectures similar to those in the training set and outfitted with parameter values from GHN-2 produced an average top-5 accuracy of 27.2 percent compared to GHN-1’s 17.2 percent.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> GHN-2 took only a fraction of a second to generate better-than-random parameter values, while training a ResNet-50 to convergence on ImageNet can take over one week on a 32GB Nvidia V100 GPU. (To be fair, after that week-plus of training, the ResNet-50’s accuracy can be 92.9 percent — a far better result.)<br><br><strong>We're thinking:</strong> The authors also found that initializing a model with GHN-2 boosted its accuracy after fine-tuning with a small amount of data. How much additional time did the initialization save compared to conventional initialization and fine-tuning?</p>","comment_id":"623231096628a8003da4c350","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-16-at-1--1-.jpg","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-03-16T11:48:41.000-07:00","updated_at":"2022-10-05T14:56:39.000-07:00","published_at":"2022-03-16T11:54:22.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"Last week, I wrote about the grand challenge of artificial general intelligence.
