The key to whether this is a good idea is whether you can quickly assess the output quality, so you can decide whether to provide more context. In this post, I’d like to share when and how I use “lazy prompting.”</p><p>When debugging code, many developers copy-paste error messages — sometimes pages of them — into an LLM without further instructions. Most LLMs are smart enough to figure out that you want them to help understand and propose fixes, so you don’t need to explicitly tell them. With brief instructions like “Edit this: …” or “sample dotenv code” (to remind you how to write code to use Python's dotenv package), an LLM will often generate a good response. Further, if the response is flawed, hopefully you can spot any problems and refine the prompt, for example to steer how the LLM edits your text.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, sometimes &nbsp;I spend 30 minutes carefully writing a 2-page prompt to get an AI system to help me solve a problem (for example to write many pages of code) that otherwise would have taken me much longer.</p><p>I don’t try a lazy prompt if (i) I feel confident there’s no chance the LLM will provide a good solution without additional context.&nbsp;For example, given a partial program spec, does even a skilled human developer have a chance of understanding what you want? If I absolutely want to use a particular piece of pdf-to-text conversion software (like my team LandingAI’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://landing.ai/agentic-document-extraction?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9pF5nDvN8DqUslWnSEP58TIvJ1x91RCild8KocqyU23j2HlYPalzmO6RL3RLOd3BejGcR3\" rel=\"noopener\">Agentic Doc Extraction</a>!), I should say so in the prompt, since otherwise it’s very hard for the LLM to guess my preference. I also wouldn’t use a lazy prompt if (ii) a buggy implementation would take a long time to detect. For example, if the only way for me to figure out if the output is incorrect is to laboriously run the code to check its functionality, it would be better to spend the time up-front to give context that would increase the odds of the LLM generating what I want.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/unnamed--57-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Cartoon of a relaxed man saying “Relax!

On average, I see more people giving too little context to LLMs than too much. Laziness is a good technique only when you’ve learned how to provide enough context, and then deliberately step back to see how little context you can get away with and still have it work. Also, lazy prompting applies only when you can iterate quickly using an LLM’s web or app interface It doesn’t apply to prompts written in code for the purpose of repeatedly calling an API, since presumably you won’t be examining every output to clarify and iterate if the output is poor.</p><p>Thank you to Rohit Prsad, who has been collaborating with me on the open-source package&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9pF5nDvN8DqUslWnSEP58TIvJ1x91RCild8KocqyU23j2HlYPalzmO6RL3RLOd3BejGcR3\" rel=\"noopener\">aisuite</a>, for suggesting the term lazy prompting.

It analyzed conversations for emotional cues and tracked users’ percentages of emotional messages over time (decreasing, flat, or increasing). The team validated classification accuracy by comparing the classifier’s outputs with survey responses.</li><li>The randomized controlled trial asked nearly 1,000 participants over 28 days to engage in particular conversation types (open-ended, personal, or non-personal) and modalities (text, interactions with ChatGPT’s neutral voice, or interactions with an engaging voice), controlling for variables like duration and age. Each participant spent at least five minutes per day interacting with ChatGPT, guided by prompts (such as “Help me reflect on a treasured memory”) and surveys (baseline, daily, weekly, and final). The study classified over 300,000 messages to identify qualities like loneliness and dependence and sorted them according to conversation type and modality.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;Both studies found that using ChatGPT was associated with reduced loneliness and increased emotional chat. However, it was also associated with decreased interpersonal social interaction and greater dependence on the chatbot, especially among users who spent more time chatting.</p><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong>&nbsp;The authors of the randomized controlled trial acknowledged significant limitations. For instance, the study lacked a non-ChatGPT control group to differentiate AI-specific effects from influences such as seasonal emotional shifts, and the trial’s time frame and assignments may not mirror real-world behavior.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;As AI chatbot behavior becomes more human-like, people may lean on large language models to satisfy emotional needs such as easing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10779105/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9pF5nDvN8DqUslWnSEP58TIvJ1x91RCild8KocqyU23j2HlYPalzmO6RL3RLOd3BejGcR3\">loneliness</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3544548.3581154?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9pF5nDvN8DqUslWnSEP58TIvJ1x91RCild8KocqyU23j2HlYPalzmO6RL3RLOd3BejGcR3\">grief</a>.

But if the system is designed to learn a 3D animation for a specific example motion, videos can stand in for motion capture. Current video generation models can take an image of a scene and generate a clip of realistic human motion and interactions with a wide variety of objects within it. From there, we can minimize the difference between the video frames and images of actions within the scene.</p><p><strong>How it works:&nbsp;</strong>ZeroHSI takes a pre-built 3D scene that includes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9pF5nDvN8DqUslWnSEP58TIvJ1x91RCild8KocqyU23j2HlYPalzmO6RL3RLOd3BejGcR3\" rel=\"noopener\">3D human mesh</a>&nbsp;and 3D object. It uses a rendered image of the scene to generate a video. Then it uses the video to help compute the motions of a human figure and object within the scene.</p><ul><li>The authors fed ZeroHSI a 3D scene complete with 3D human mesh and 3D object.

Kling produced a video clip.</li><li>For each generated video frame, ZeroHSI rendered a new image of the 3D scene and minimized a loss function with four terms. It used the loss function to calculate how to change the poses of the 3D human, 3D object, and camera in the 3D scene to match their poses in the video frame. For example, one loss term minimized pixel-level differences between the image and video frame. Another minimized the difference between the object’s center in the image and in a segmentation mask of the video frame produced by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00714?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9pF5nDvN8DqUslWnSEP58TIvJ1x91RCild8KocqyU23j2HlYPalzmO6RL3RLOd3BejGcR3\" rel=\"noopener\">SAM 2</a>.</li><li>The system sometimes produced errors. For instance, one of the human figure’s hands might fail to touch the object, or the object penetrated the human figure’s body. To remedy this, for each video frame, the authors refined the poses in a separate phase that involved three loss terms. For instance, one term minimized the distance between surfaces of a hand and the object to prevent penetration or distance between them.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:&nbsp;</strong>The authors evaluated ZeroHSI using a proprietary dataset of 12 3D scenes that included a human figure and an object and between one and three text prompts that described interactions between the human and object and/or scene.

ZeroHSI achieved 0.033 average object penetration depth, a measure of plausibility in physical interactions (lower is better), while LINGO achieved 0.242 average object penetration depth.</li><li>400 participants judged whether they preferred ZeroHSI or LINGO with respect to realism and how well their output aligned with the prompt. 86.9 percent preferred ZeroHSI for realism, and 89.1 percent preferred ZeroHSI for how well its output matched the prompt.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Learning from motion-capture data is problematic in a couple of ways: (i) it’s expensive to produce, (ii) so little of it is available, which limits how much a learning algorithm can generalize from it. Video data, on the other hand, is available in endless variety, enabling video generation models to generalize across a wide variety of scenes, objects, and motions. ZeroHSI takes advantage of generated video to guide a 3D animation cheaply and effectively.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;There’s a lot of progress to be made in AI simply by finding
