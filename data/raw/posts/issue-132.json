In official Gran Turismo Sport competitions — as in real-world races — a human referee makes these calls and penalizes errant drivers. A reinforcement learning algorithm can model such judgments by assigning a cost to each collision, but it must be tuned to avoid an adverse effect on performance: Too high a penalty and drivers become timid, too low and they become dangerous. Penalizing common situations in which a driver typically would be judged at fault, such as rear-ending, side-swiping, and colliding on a curve, should help a neural network learn to drive boldly without ramming its opponents to gain an advantage.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Given information about the car and its environment, a vanilla neural network decided how to steer and accelerate. The authors trained the network on three virtual tracks and in custom scenarios, such as the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hINkcLyjiYc&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RhFk9pm3pqM9Pxb0jGpbnkPxK5q9cuN-jQd01NItlS_yRnjV4wxE95HCuA3mooR6_smgR\" rel=\"noopener\">slingshot pass</a>, that pitted the model against itself, previous iterations of itself, and the in-game AI.</p><ul><li>Ten times a second, a vanilla neural network decided how much to accelerate or brake and how much to turn left or right depending on several variables: the car’s velocity, acceleration, orientation, weight on each tire, position, the data points that described the environment ahead, the positions of surrounding cars, whether it was colliding with a wall or another car, and whether it was off-course.</li><li>During training, a reinforcement learning algorithm rewarded the model for traveling and for gaining ground on opponents. It applied a penalty for skidding, touching a wall, allowing an opponent to gain ground, going off-course, and colliding with an opponent. It further penalized the typical at-fault scenarios.</li><li>A separate vanilla neural network, given the information about the car and environment, learned to predict the future reward for taking a given action.</li><li>The first network learned to take actions that maximized the predicted future reward.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> In time trials, GT Sophy achieved faster lap times than three of the world’s top Gran Turismo Sport drivers. In addition, a team of four GT Sophys faced off against four of the best human drivers in two sets of three head-to-head races held months apart. Points were awarded based on the cars’ final positions: 10 points for first place, 8 for second, 6 for third, and from 5 to 1 point for the remaining positions. The human team won the first set 86 to 70. Then the developers increased the model size and changed some rewards and features, among other tweaks, and the GT Sophy team won the second set 104 to 52.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Unlike board games like Chess and Go in which learning algorithms have beaten human champions, winning a car race requires making complex decisions at high speed while tracing a fine line between nudging and disabling opponents. That said, there’s still a significant gap between doing well in even an exceptionally realistic video game and driving a real car.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Autonomous driving requires perception, planning, and control. We have little doubt that the latest algorithms can outperform most human drivers in control, but a substantial gap remains in perception and planning.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table class=\"hse-image-wrapper\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px !important;\"><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(59, 59, 59); word-break: break-word; text-align: center; padding: 5px 0px 10px; font-size: 0px;\"><img alt=\"APPLE\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/5871640/hubfs/APPLE.gif?upscale=true&amp;width=1200&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=APPLE.gif\" width=\"600\" align=\"middle\" class=\"stretch-on-mobile\" style=\"outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width: 100%; font-size: 16px;\"></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><h1 id=\"remix-master\">Remix Master</h1><p>Music generated by learning algorithms got a major push with Apple’s acquisition of a startup that makes automated mash-ups.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Apple purchased <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220124094812/https://www.aimusic.co.uk/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RhFk9pm3pqM9Pxb0jGpbnkPxK5q9cuN-jQd01NItlS_yRnjV4wxE95HCuA3mooR6_smgR\" rel=\"noopener\">AI Music</a>, a London startup whose software generates new music from existing recordings, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-07/apple-buys-startup-that-makes-music-with-artificial-intelligence?sref=P6Q0mxvj&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RhFk9pm3pqM9Pxb0jGpbnkPxK5q9cuN-jQd01NItlS_yRnjV4wxE95HCuA3mooR6_smgR\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reported.<br><strong>How it works:</strong> Founded in 2016, AI Music reshapes prerecorded music according to user input.

This trend runs counter to the fear expressed by some economists amid the first wave of pandemic-driven lockdowns that the shift to remote work would prompt employers to lay off employees and automate their jobs. Japan and South Korea, whose unemployment rates are among the lowest among developed countries — 2.8 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively — are also the world’s most automated economies.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Fear that <a href=\"https://read.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/machines-take-everyones-job/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">automatons will take jobs from humans</a> fuels distrust in AI. Research that counters this notion could help improve public confidence in the technology.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Even if automation fosters job growth on a statistical basis, it clearly threatens specific jobs in specific industries.

Lawrence at University of Cambridge <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04105?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RhFk9pm3pqM9Pxb0jGpbnkPxK5q9cuN-jQd01NItlS_yRnjV4wxE95HCuA3mooR6_smgR\" rel=\"noopener\">compared</a> the work required to build a business-oriented machine learning program using a service oriented architecture (SOA) and flow-based programming (FBP).<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> SOA divides a program into services — bundles of functions and memory for, say, navigation, payment processing, and collecting customer ratings in a ride-sharing app — connected to a central hub that passes messages among them. In this arrangement, machine learning applications that draw on large databases generate a high volume of messages, which can require a lot of computation and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09926?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RhFk9pm3pqM9Pxb0jGpbnkPxK5q9cuN-jQd01NItlS_yRnjV4wxE95HCuA3mooR6_smgR\" rel=\"noopener\">time spent debugging</a>. FBP, by contrast, conceives a program as a network of functions, or nodes, that exchange data directly with one another. This approach cuts the amount of communication required and makes it easier to track data paths, making it easier to build efficient machine learning programs.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Over three phases of development, the authors used SOA and FBT to implement taxi-booking applications that took advantage of machine learning. Then they measured the impact of each programming approach on code size, ease of revision, and code complexity.</p><ul><li>In Phase 1, the authors built separate modules that assigned drivers to incoming ride requests, kept track of rides, updated information such as passenger pickup and drop-off times, and measured passenger wait times. SOA called for rider and driver services, while FBP required nodes to handle the interactions among each data stream, such as allocating a ride or calculating the wait time.</li><li>In Phase 2, they added the ability to collect simulated ride requests, driver locations, and rider wait times. Using SOA, they built a new service and modified each previous service to collect the data. Using FBP, they added a node to capture these inputs and outputs.</li><li>In Phase 3, they added a machine learning model trained to estimate passenger wait times using the data collected in Phase 2. The changes required in both approaches were similar. Using FBP, they added a node; using SOA, they added a service.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Both approaches showed distinct benefits. FBP produced a better cognitive complexity score (a measurement of how difficult a code is to understand, where higher is more difficult) in all phases of development. For instance, in Phase 3, FPB scored 1.4 while SOA scored 2.0. On the other hand, the SOA code was easier to revise and less complex in all phases of development. (The authors point out that SOA may have scored higher because it’s more widely used and many libraries exist to reduce code size and complexity. With similar libraries, FBT might catch up.)<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> FBP provided a better developer experience during data collection, according to the authors’ subjective evaluation. This would allow developers to spend more time optimizing data capture and quality. In addition, reducing the expertise required for data collection could enable machine learning engineers to play a bigger role in that process and improve a model’s performance from the data up.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Given the ambiguous results, going with the flow might mean sticking with the more familiar SOA approach.</p>","comment_id":"6217cf99644337003d9563ef","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-15-at-2.10.22-PM.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-02-24T10:34:01.000-08:00","updated_at":"2022-10-05T15:00:18.000-07:00","published_at":"2022-02-16T12:00:00.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"We just launched a Data-Centric AI Resource Hub to help you improve the performance of AI systems by systematically engineering the underlying data.
