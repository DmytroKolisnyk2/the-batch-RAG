I had many conversations along two major themes:<br><br><strong>Business implementation of AI.&nbsp;</strong>Many businesses, and to a lesser extent governments, are looking at using AI and trying to develop best practices for doing so.

For example, some are still using the argument, “don't we want to know if your open-source LLMs are safe?” to promote potentially onerous testing, reporting, and perhaps even licensing requirements on open-source software. While we would, of course, prefer safe models (just as we would prefer secure software and truthful speech), overly burdensome “protections” could still destroy much innovation without materially reducing harm. &nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Fortunately, many regulators are now aware of the need to protect basic research and development. The battle is still on to make sure we can continue to freely distribute the fruits of R&amp;D, including open-sourcing software. But I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in the last few months.&nbsp;</em></li></ul><p><em>I also went to some climate sessions to listen to speakers. Unfortunately, I came away from them feeling more pessimistic about what governments and corporations are doing on decarbonization and climate change. I will say more about this in future letters, but:</em></p><ul><li><em>Although some experts still talk about 1.5 degrees of warming as an optimistic scenario and 2 degrees as a pessimistic scenario, my own view after reviewing the science is that 2 degrees is a very optimistic scenario, and 4 degrees is a more realistic pessimistic scenario.</em></li><li><em>Unfortunately, this overoptimism is causing us to underinvest in resilience and adaptation (to help us better weather the coming changes) as well as put less effort into exploring potentially game-changing technologies like geo-engineering.&nbsp;</em></li></ul><p><em>Davos is a cold city where temperatures are often below freezing. In one memorable moment at the conference, I had lost my gloves and my hands were freezing. A stranger whom I had met only minutes ago kindly gave me an extra pair. This generous act reminded me that, even as we think about the global impacts of AI and climate change, simple human kindness touches people's hearts and reminds us that the ultimate purpose of our work is to help people.</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p><em>P.S. Check out our new short course on “Automated Testing for LLMOps,” taught by CircleCI CTO Rob Zuber! This course teaches how you can adapt key ideas from continuous integration (CI), a pillar of efficient software engineering, to building applications based on large language models (LLMs). Tweaking an LLM-based app can have unexpected side effects, and having automated testing as part of your approach to LLMOps (LLM Operations) helps avoid these problems. CI is especially important for AI applications given the iterative nature of AI development, which often involves many incremental changes.

The authors modified the proof finder to deduce proofs from not only geometric concepts but also algebraic concepts such as ratios, angles, and distances. (ii) A transformer learned to read and write proofs in the proof finder’s specialized language.</p><ul><li>The authors generated a synthetic dataset of 100 million geometric premises, propositions, and their proofs. For instance, given the premise, “Let ABC be any triangle with AB = AC” (an isosceles triangle) and the proposition “∠ABC = ∠BCA,” the proof involves constructing a line between A and the midpoint between B and C. The authors translated these problems into the proof finder’s language. They pretrained the transformer, given a premise and proposition, to generate the proof.&nbsp;</li><li>The authors modified 9 million proofs in the dataset to remove references to some lines, shapes, or points from premises. Instead, they introduced these elements in statements of the related proofs. They fine-tuned the transformer, given a modified premise, the proposition, and the proof up to that point, to generate the added elements.</li><li>At inference, given a premise and proposition, the proof finder added statements. If it failed to produce the proposition, the system fed the statements so far to the transformer, which predicted a point, shape, or line that might be helpful in deducing the next statement. Then it gave the premise, proposition, and proof so far — including the new element — to the proof finder. The system repeated the process until the proof finder produced the proposition.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors tested AlphaGeometry on 30 problems posed by the International Mathematical Olympiad, an annual competition for high school students. Comparing that score to human performance isn’t so straightforward because human competitors can receive partial credit. Human gold medalists since 2000 solved 25.9 problems correctly, silver medalists solved 22.9 problems, and bronze medalists solved 19.3 problems. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/9789812791085_0008?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RkkzWCPrBmuh9NVI-bYNqrsXRmAT-YaZPJ1dtehWVcy_vEf9eASvXIDg_sxgmyWQI4kiP\" rel=\"noopener\">previous state-of-the-art approach</a>&nbsp;solved 10 problems, and the modified proof finder solved 14 problems. In one instance, the system identified an unused premise and found a more generalized proof than required, effectively solving many similar problems at once.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Existing AI systems can juggle symbols and follow simple rules of deduction, but they struggle with steps that human mathematicians represent visually by, say, drawing a diagram. It’s possible to make up this deficit by (i) alternating between a large language model (LLM) and a proof finder, (ii) combining geometric and algebraic reasoning, and (ii) training the LLM on a large data set. The result is a breakthrough for geometric problem solving.</p><p><strong>We're thinking:</strong>&nbsp;In 1993, the teenaged Andrew Ng represented Singapore in the International Mathematics Olympiad, where he&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=3444&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RkkzWCPrBmuh9NVI-bYNqrsXRmAT-YaZPJ1dtehWVcy_vEf9eASvXIDg_sxgmyWQI4kiP\" rel=\"noopener\">won</a>&nbsp;a silver medal.
