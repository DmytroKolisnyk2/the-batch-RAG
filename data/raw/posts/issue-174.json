This raises worries that they will flood the world with misinformation. If they could moderate their degree of confidence appropriately, they would be less likely to mislead.</em><br><br><em>People are prone to following authority figures. Because a lot of text on the internet is written in an authoritative style — hopefully because the authors know what they’re talking about— LLMs have learned to mimic this style. Unfortunately, LLMs can speak in this style even when they get the facts completely wrong.</em></p><p><em>We don’t expect people to be right all the time, but we don’t like it when they’re simultaneously confident and wrong. Real experts speak in a range of styles: confident when we know what we’re talking about, but also explaining the boundaries of our knowledge when we run up against them and helping the audience understand the range of possibilities. For example, when asked how to build an AI application, I might propose one approach but also describe the range of algorithms one might consider. Knowing what you know and don’t know is a useful trait of expertise.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/unnamed--8--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Question asked by Andrew Ng and asked by the latest version of ChatGPT \" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/unnamed--8--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/unnamed--8--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/unnamed--8--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Playing with ChatGPT, the latest language model from OpenAI, I found it to be an impressive advance from its predecessor GPT-3.

Transformers, for all their utility in computer vision, aren’t well suited to this because of their steep computational and memory requirements. A new approach could change that.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> Agrim Gupta and colleagues at Stanford devised <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11894?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8XjBEEP00yIrrRqQpjZpRbLTTu43MsTgd_x1CY9LpJfucuxVrmZG6TTxKTB8uHvO-BrYjm\" rel=\"noopener\">Masked Visual Pre-Training for Video Prediction (MaskViT)</a>, a transformer model that generates likely future video frames with far less computation than earlier transformer-based approaches.

The amount of processing required for this approach is manageable when generating an image, which may be divided among hundreds or thousands of tokens. But it becomes very time-consuming when generating video, which involves many images. Predicting multiple tokens at once reduces the number of forward passes needed to generate video, significantly accelerating the process.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> MaskViT consists of an image tokenizer (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.0984?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8XjBEEP00yIrrRqQpjZpRbLTTu43MsTgd_x1CY9LpJfucuxVrmZG6TTxKTB8uHvO-BrYjm\" rel=\"noopener\">VQ-GAN</a>, a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8XjBEEP00yIrrRqQpjZpRbLTTu43MsTgd_x1CY9LpJfucuxVrmZG6TTxKTB8uHvO-BrYjm\" rel=\"noopener\">discrete variational autoencoder</a>) and a transformer.

Different models take different amounts of time to run, so there’s no guarantee that a smaller number of forward passes takes less time. That said, given differences between the options for hardware, machine learning libraries, and programming languages, it would be hard to compare execution speeds directly.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> While the reduction of forward passes is notable, the authors also came up with an interesting way to improve output quality. During inference, 100 percent of the tokens to be generated start out missing and fill in slowly over the generation process. However, in the typical training practice, which masks a fixed percentage of tokens, the model never encounters such a large percentage of missing tokens. Instead, during training, the authors masked a variable portion of tokens up to 100 percent. This procedure better aligned the tasks during training and inference, which yielded better results.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Giving robots the ability to predict visual changes could make for a generation of much safer and more capable machines.
