But within this broad framework, a huge design space and numerous innovations are available to experiment with.

An interesting result from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2312.13010v2?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8IW_mtWbMjRpUm1n1yIADSQ3OWM-lcCDorLB3v-M59gSiEEPtLU7MYnmlKydJVIZ_AhCYQ\" rel=\"noopener\">AgentCoder</a>&nbsp;shows that having separate agents for writing code and generating tests results in better performance than letting a single agent do both tasks. This is presumably because, if the agent writing the code is also responsible for writing the tests, the tests might be influenced by the code and fail to consider corner cases that the code does not cover.&nbsp;</p><p>When people think of testing code, many initially think of output testing, in which we see if the code generates the correct outputs to a specific set of test inputs. If the code fails a test, an LLM can be prompted to reflect on why the code failed and then to try to fix it. In addition to testing the output, the LDB method is helpful. LDB steps through the code and presents to the LLM values of the variables during intermediate steps of execution, to see if the LLM can spot exactly where the error is. This mimics how a human developer might step through the code to see where one of the computational steps went wrong, and so pinpoint and fix the problem.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/06/unnamed---2024-06-19T154106.403.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/06/unnamed---2024-06-19T154106.403.png 600w\"></figure><p>A lot of agentic workflows mimic human workflows. Similar to other work in machine learning, if humans can do a task, then trying to mimic humans makes development much easier compared to inventing a new process. However, the authors of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15793?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8IW_mtWbMjRpUm1n1yIADSQ3OWM-lcCDorLB3v-M59gSiEEPtLU7MYnmlKydJVIZ_AhCYQ\" rel=\"noopener\">SWE-agent</a>&nbsp;noticed that many tools that humans use for coding are very inefficient for agents. For example, giving an agent access to a bash shell and having it find a piece of code by executing numerous cd, ls, and cat commands is inefficient, even though humans can do this rapidly. Similarly, visual coding editors like VSCode, emacs, and vim are easy for humans to use, but hard for LLMs (or LMMs) to navigate. Because agents interact with computers differently than humans do, the authors found that building special-purpose tools (functions) to let an agent search, view, and edit codebases resulted in better performance.&nbsp;</p><p>One reason research into coding agents is making rapid progress is that their performance can be evaluated automatically and reliably. With benchmarks like HumanEval, MBPP, and SWE-bench, researchers can try out an idea and automatically test how often it generates correct code. In contrast, even though there’s considerable activity on AI research agents that search the web and synthesize an article (I’ve enjoyed using the open-source&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8IW_mtWbMjRpUm1n1yIADSQ3OWM-lcCDorLB3v-M59gSiEEPtLU7MYnmlKydJVIZ_AhCYQ\" rel=\"noopener\">STORM</a>&nbsp;system by Stanford's Yijia Shao et al.), they are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/we-need-better-evals-for-llm-applications/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8IW_mtWbMjRpUm1n1yIADSQ3OWM-lcCDorLB3v-M59gSiEEPtLU7MYnmlKydJVIZ_AhCYQ\" rel=\"noopener\">hard to evaluate</a>&nbsp;and this makes progress harder.&nbsp;</p><p>Github Copilot was released in 2021, and many developers have been getting coding help by prompting LLMs. The rapid evolution from that to more sophisticated coding agents is expanding how computers can help us with coding tasks, and the pace of progress is rapid.

Now users can create passages by uploading audio clips and extending them or modifying them by, say, adding or removing instruments or vocals complete with lyrics.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>In the demonstration video linked above, Udio adds a singing voice to an instrumental backing track using the prompt “funk, female vocalist.” Other examples enhance an electronic beat with a guitar melody and fill out hard-rock drums with a guitar riff and wailing voice.</li><li>Users are responsible for securing legal rights to use audio files they upload.

Diffusion models are slower because they remove noise from a noisy image over many steps. A diffusion model can learn to generate images in a single denoising step if, like a GAN, it learns to fool a discriminator, while the discriminator learns to identify generated output. The resulting one-step output doesn’t match the quality of multi-step diffusion, but distillation can improve it: While learning to fool the discriminator, the diffusion model (the student) can simultaneously learn to emulate the output of a different pretrained diffusion model (the teacher).</p><p><strong>How it works:&nbsp;</strong>The authors paired a pretrained&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01952?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8IW_mtWbMjRpUm1n1yIADSQ3OWM-lcCDorLB3v-M59gSiEEPtLU7MYnmlKydJVIZ_AhCYQ\" rel=\"noopener\">Stable Diffusion XL</a>&nbsp;(SDXL) generator (the student) with a pretrained&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8IW_mtWbMjRpUm1n1yIADSQ3OWM-lcCDorLB3v-M59gSiEEPtLU7MYnmlKydJVIZ_AhCYQ\" rel=\"noopener\">DINOv2</a>&nbsp;vision transformer discriminator.

They compared the student’s output after either one or four denoising steps to a pretrained SDXL after 50 denoising steps. Human judges were asked which they preferred with respect to (i) image quality and (ii) alignment with the prompt. They preferred the student’s four-step images about 57 percent of the time for image quality and about 55 percent of the time for alignment with the prompt. They preferred SDXL to the student’s one-step images around 58 percent of the time for image quality and 52 percent of the time for alignment with the prompt.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;In this work, the key steps — having a student model learn from a teacher model, and training a generator against a discriminator&nbsp;— are established techniques in their own right.
