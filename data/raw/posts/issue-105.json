What can you do?</em><br><br><em>It is hard to tweak a learning algorithm’s code to improve its performance specifically on one slice of the data. Often, tuning an algorithm changes its performance on everything.</em><br><br><em>But you can engineer the training and test data for that subset. A data-centric approach to AI development is a powerful tool to improve model performance on one slice, hopefully without degrading its performance on other portions of the data.</em><br><br><em>The need to improve performance on one slice is a common one. For example:</em></p><ul><li><em>A loan-making algorithm has high average accuracy but makes biased decisions on applications from one minority group. How can you fix the performance to provide loans more fairly — especially if membership in that group is not an explicit feature?</em></li><li><em>A speech recognition algorithm is accurate for many users but inaccurate when car noise is in the background. How can you improve its performance to recognize words spoken in a moving vehicle?</em></li><li><em>A robot is good at grasping many types of household objects, except for monochromatic ones that are uniform in color and texture. How can you enable the robot to fetch that red rubber ball?</em></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-17-at-7.17.33-PM-copy-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Data-Centric AI Development Iterative Workflow\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-17-at-7.17.33-PM-copy-1.png 600w\"></figure><p><em>Improving the data is sometimes misunderstood as a pre-processing step performed prior to engineering a machine learning algorithm. Instead, it should be a key step in the iterative loop of model development, in which data is engineered systematically to address problems identified through error analysis.</em></p><p><em>Specifically, if error analysis identifies a slice of data that yields subpar performance, you might improve the data by:</em></p><ul><li><em>Improving the label quality for that slice. For example, you can check if labelers consistently assign the same label </em>y<em> to the same input </em>x<em> and, if not, provide clearer labeling instructions to improve consistency.</em></li><li><em>Using data collection, augmentation, or synthesis to add data to the problematic slice. For example, to improve performance on speech with car noise, you might use data augmentation to generate more data with car noise for the algorithm to learn from.</em></li></ul><p><em>Rather than applying these techniques to all the data — which would be costly and inefficient — you can focus on improving the label quality </em>(y)<em> and/or getting new training examples </em>(x)<em> in the slice you want to improve. This is a much less costly exercise.</em></p><p><em>Data-centric AI development is especially powerful in the current era of large neural networks. A decade ago, when models were much smaller, adding data in one place would often hurt performance elsewhere. For example, adding data on monochromatic objects might make it hard for an algorithm to recognize other objects if it doesn’t have enough capacity to recognize both types equally well.</em></p><p><em>There are situations in which adding data can hurt, but for many unstructured data problems (vision, speech, language), as long as the added data is clean and the learning algorithm is large enough, it's possible to add data in a way that improves performance on one slice without hurting performance on others.

The new champion is a basic RL architecture plus a trick borrowed from image generation.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong> A team led by Florin Gogianu, Tudor Berariu, and colleagues <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05246?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9afvWbqiy2a0IX_eyHyu4Fqx7rgJFjQ_tESMg_rzfMjihCTsjiByW5W_ysOc2FlnUqjoD0CFxFSCI8296zoNeIwb2Uig\">found</a> that spectral normalization, a technique that limits the degree of variation between representations of similar inputs, improved an RL model’s performance more than several recent innovations combined. The team included researchers at Bitdefender, Deepmind, Imperial College London, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, and University College London.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> In reinforcement learning, a model observes its environment (say, the Atari game <a href=\"https://www.ponggame.org/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9afvWbqiy2a0IX_eyHyu4Fqx7rgJFjQ_tESMg_rzfMjihCTsjiByW5W_ysOc2FlnUqjoD0CFxFSCI8296zoNeIwb2Uig\">Pong</a>), chooses an action based on its observation (such as moving the paddle), and receives a reward for a desirable outcome (like scoring a point). Learning in this way can be difficult because, as a model selects different actions, its training data (observations and rewards) change. Mutable training data poses a similar problem for generative adversarial networks (GANs), where generator and discriminator networks influence each other even as they themselves change. Spectral normalization has been <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05957?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9afvWbqiy2a0IX_eyHyu4Fqx7rgJFjQ_tESMg_rzfMjihCTsjiByW5W_ysOc2FlnUqjoD0CFxFSCI8296zoNeIwb2Uig\">shown</a> to help GANs learn by moderating these changes. It could also be beneficial in reinforcement learning.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors added spectral normalization to a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9afvWbqiy2a0IX_eyHyu4Fqx7rgJFjQ_tESMg_rzfMjihCTsjiByW5W_ysOc2FlnUqjoD0CFxFSCI8296zoNeIwb2Uig\">C51</a>, a convolutional neural network designed for reinforcement learning. The authors trained their model on tasks in the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4708?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9afvWbqiy2a0IX_eyHyu4Fqx7rgJFjQ_tESMg_rzfMjihCTsjiByW5W_ysOc2FlnUqjoD0CFxFSCI8296zoNeIwb2Uig\">Arcade Learning Environment</a>, a selection of games in which the actions are valid Atari controller movements.</p><ul><li>Given an observation, a C51 predicts a set of distributions of the likely reward for taking each possible action. Then it selects the action that would bring the highest expected reward. During training, it refines its prediction by sampling and comparing predicted rewards to actual rewards.</li><li>Spectral normalization constrains parameter values in network layers, such that the distance between any two predictions is, at most, the distance between the inputs times a constant factor (chosen by the user). The smaller the factor, the more similar a network’s predictions must be. During training, spectral normalization limits the magnitude of a layer’s weights. If an update exceeds that limit, it divides the weights evenly so their magnitude is equal to the limit.</li><li>The authors argue that limiting weight changes is akin to dampening learning rates. They devised an optimization method that lowered the model’s learning rate proportionately to spectral normalization’s limit on the weights. Models trained either way performed nearly equally.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Using spectral normalization on every layer impeded performance, but using it on only the second-to-last layer led the model to achieve a higher median reward. The authors compared their C51 with spectral normalization on the second-to-last layer against <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9afvWbqiy2a0IX_eyHyu4Fqx7rgJFjQ_tESMg_rzfMjihCTsjiByW5W_ysOc2FlnUqjoD0CFxFSCI8296zoNeIwb2Uig\">Rainbow</a>, the previous state of the art, which outfits a C51 with a variety of RL techniques. In 54 Atari games, the authors’ approach achieved a 248.45 median reward, outperforming Rainbow’s 227.05 median reward.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Applying techniques from one area of machine learning, such as GANs, to a superficially different area, such as RL, can be surprisingly fruitful! In this case, it opens the door to much simpler RL models and perhaps opportunities to improve existing techniques.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> People who have expertise in multiple disciplines can be exceptionally creative, spotting opportunities for cross-fertilization among disparate fields. AI is now big enough to offer a cornucopia of opportunities for such interdisciplinary insight.</p>","comment_id":"611d5d410c27d4003b5f9356","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-17-at-7.17.33-PM-copy.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2021-08-18T12:19:29.000-07:00","updated_at":"2022-10-06T07:00:37.000-07:00","published_at":"2021-08-18T12:00:00.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"Say you’ve trained a learning algorithm and found that it works well on many examples but performs poorly on a particular subset, or slice, of the data.
