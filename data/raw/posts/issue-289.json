Many statistics show that AI impacts billions of lives, but sometimes a story still hits me emotionally. Let me share what happened.</p><p>Skyfire AI, an AI Fund portfolio company led by CEO&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/donmathis/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qVI6MBRjIl2hLEBqO4RZvQJH4pvd4nZXit45O6p5UMtP69X3bON0IxQJPVbEMNaW4P_7o\" rel=\"noopener\">Don Mathis</a>, operates a public safety program in which drones function as first responders to 911 calls. Particularly when a police department is personnel-constrained, drones can save officers’ time while enhancing their situational awareness. For example, many burglar alarms are false alarms, maybe set off by moisture or an animal. Rather than sending a patrol officer to drive over to discover this, a drone can get there faster and determine if an officer is required at all. If the alarm is real, the drone can help officers understand the situation, the locations of any perpetrators, and how best to respond.</p><p>In January, a Skyfire AI drone was returning to base after responding to a false alarm when the police dispatcher asked us to reroute it to help locate a patrol officer. The officer had radioed a few minutes earlier that he had pulled over a suspicious vehicle and had not been heard from since. The officer had stopped where two major highways intersect in a complex cloverleaf, and dispatch was unsure exactly where they were located.</p><p>From the air, the drone rapidly located the officer and the driver of the vehicle he had pulled over, who it turned out had escaped from a local detention facility. Neither would have been visible from the road — they were fighting in a drainage ditch below the highway. Because of the complexity of the cloverleaf’s geometry, the watch officer (who coordinates police activities for the shift) later estimated it would have taken 5-7 minutes for an officer in a patrol car to find &nbsp;them.</p><p>From the aerial footage, it appeared that the officer still had his radio, but &nbsp;was losing the fight and unable to reach it to call for help. Further, it looked like the assailant might gain control of his service weapon and use it against him. This was a dire and dangerous situation.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/unnamed--52-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Thermal aerial image showing a suspect surrendering with hands raised.

The first arrived not in 5-7 minutes but in 45 seconds. Four more units arrived within minutes.</p><p>The officers were able to take control of the situation and apprehend the driver, resulting in an arrest and, more important, a safe outcome for the officer. Subsequently, the watch officer said we’d probably saved the officer’s life.</p><p>Democratic nations still have a lot of work to do on drone technology, and we must build this technology with guardrails to make sure we enhance civil liberties and human rights. But I am encouraged by the progress we’re making. In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene last year, Skyfire AI’s drones supported search-and-rescue operations under the direction of the North Carolina Office of Emergency Management, responding to specific requests to help locate missing persons and direct rescue assets (e.g., helicopters and boats) to their location, and was credited with saving 13 lives.</p><p>It’s not every day that AI directly saves someone's life. But as our technology advances, I think there will be more and more stories like these.</p><p>Keep building!</p><p>Andrew</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/evaluating-ai-agents/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-02-17T150409.455.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Promo banner for: &quot;Evaluating AI Agents&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-02-17T150409.455.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-02-17T150409.455.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-02-17T150409.455.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners---2025-02-17T150409.455.png 2100w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Learn to systematically evaluate, improve, and iterate on AI agents using structured assessments.

Competitors like Aider and Windsurf don’t offer mobile apps, and mobile apps from Cursor and Github provide chat but not mobile app development. Moreover, few coding agents can deploy apps to the cloud on the desktop or mobile.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Replit’s new mobile app produces working apps in minutes (although some early users have reported encountering bugs), and automatic deployment of apps to the cloud is a huge help. Yet it raises the stakes for developers to learn their craft and maintain a collaborative relationship with AI. While Replit’s web-based environment exposes the code, encouraging users to improve their skills, the mobile app hides much of its work below the surface. It brings AI closer to handling full software development cycles and adds urgency to questions about how to address the balance between automation and hands-on coding.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;AI continues to boost developer productivity and reduce the cost of software development, and the progress of Bolt, Cursor, Replit, Vercel, Windsurf, and others is exhilarating. We look forward to a day when, measured against the 2024 standard, every software engineer is a 10x engineer!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/unnamed--50-.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Illustration of two men staring intensely at each other against a red and yellow background, symbolizing rivalry.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/unnamed--50-.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/unnamed--50-.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/unnamed--50-.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"musk-complicates-openai%E2%80%99s-plan\">Musk Complicates OpenAI’s Plan</h1><p>Elon Musk and a group of investors made an unsolicited bid to buy the assets of the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, complicating the AI powerhouse’s future plans.</p><p><strong>What’s new:&nbsp;</strong>Musk&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-openai-bid-4af12827?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qVI6MBRjIl2hLEBqO4RZvQJH4pvd4nZXit45O6p5UMtP69X3bON0IxQJPVbEMNaW4P_7o\" rel=\"noopener\">submitted</a>&nbsp;a $97.4 billion offer to acquire the assets of the nonprofit OpenAI Inc.

His bid follows a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-open-ai-sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-6b734fe41cc24cb3029a0a863e73f190?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qVI6MBRjIl2hLEBqO4RZvQJH4pvd4nZXit45O6p5UMtP69X3bON0IxQJPVbEMNaW4P_7o\" rel=\"noopener\">lawsuit</a>&nbsp;against OpenAI, in which he claims the company abandoned its nonprofit mission in favor of profit. OpenAI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-12/musk-s-open-ai-bid-debunks-his-court-battle-claims-altman-says?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qVI6MBRjIl2hLEBqO4RZvQJH4pvd4nZXit45O6p5UMtP69X3bON0IxQJPVbEMNaW4P_7o\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a>&nbsp;that Musk’s bid contradicts his legal claims and suggests that the lawsuit should be dismissed.

Musk’s xAI is a direct competitor, and his bid, whether it’s sincere or tactical, unsettles OpenAI’s plans. Even if OpenAI moves forward as planned, Musk’s actions likely will have made the process more expensive and potentially invite closer scrutiny of the company’s actions.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;There’s ample precedence for non-profits spinning out for-profit entities. For example, non-profit universities typically create intellectual property that forms the basis of for-profit startups. The university might retain a modest stake, and this is viewed as consistent with its non-profit mission. This isn’t a perfect analogy, since OpenAI does little besides operating its AI business, but we hope the company finds a path forward that allows it to serve users, rewards its employees for their contributions, and honors its non-profit charter.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/unnamed--54-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"AI Action Summit in a grand hall with domes, flags, and a crowd attending the event.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"674\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/unnamed--54-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/unnamed--54-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/02/unnamed--54-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"world-powers-move-to-lighten-ai-regulation\">World Powers Move to Lighten AI Regulation</h1><p>The latest international AI summit exposed deep divisions between major world powers regarding AI regulations.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;While previous summits emphasized existential risks, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.elysee.fr/en/sommet-pour-l-action-sur-l-ia?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qVI6MBRjIl2hLEBqO4RZvQJH4pvd4nZXit45O6p5UMtP69X3bON0IxQJPVbEMNaW4P_7o\" rel=\"noopener\">AI Action Summit</a>&nbsp;in Paris marked a turning point.
