Newly leaked documents shed light on the company’s formula for prioritizing posts in an individual user’s feed.</p><p><strong>What happened:</strong> <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/26/facebook-angry-emoji-algorithm/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_jBiBIcM1il6lj7UckpMdiJVS-UroVO2A8HqlHVWB2YwTE2EinyOsLMj2u5SytA1gn8atm\" rel=\"noopener\">analyzed</a> internal documents and interviewed employees to show how the company’s weighting of emojis, videos, subject matter, and other factors have evolved in recent years. The <em>Post</em>’s analysis followed up on an earlier <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_jBiBIcM1il6lj7UckpMdiJVS-UroVO2A8HqlHVWB2YwTE2EinyOsLMj2u5SytA1gn8atm\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> Facebook’s recommendation algorithm ranks posts for their likelihood to spur engagement according to more than 10,000 variables. Posts earn points for various attributes, and those with the highest score float to the top of a user’s newsfeed. The average post scores a few hundred points, but scores can reach 1 billion or more. Facebook is constantly adjusting the algorithm. The details below were drawn from past documents and may not reflect the current iteration:</p><ul><li>The algorithm awards points depending on the types of stories likely to spur shares and interactions (health and civic information may count for less as of spring 2020), whether video is included (live videos score higher than prerecorded clips), number of likes (1 point each), number of reaction emojis (0 to 2 points as of September 2020), number of reshares (5 points as of January 2018), number of text comments and their length (15 to 30 points as of January 2018, single-character comments don’t count). The algorithm also weighs the user’s friend list (comments by strangers count less), groups the user has joined, pages the user has liked, and advertisers that have targeted the user. In addition, it considers the post’s processing burden and the strength of the user’s internet signal.</li><li>To limit the spread of posts the company deems harmful — for instance, those that include hateful messages or disinformation — the algorithm slashes their scores between <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/how-facebook-algorithms-can-fight-over-your-feed-quicktake?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_jBiBIcM1il6lj7UckpMdiJVS-UroVO2A8HqlHVWB2YwTE2EinyOsLMj2u5SytA1gn8atm\" rel=\"noopener\">50 and 90 percent</a>. But there’s no upper limit to the number of points a post can accrue, so this penalty has little effect on the rank of posts with extremely high scores.</li><li>Until January 6, Facebook favored posts that include live video over other media types, weighting them up to 600 times more heavily than those with pre-recorded videos, photos, or text. The company capped the multiplier at 60 after the attack on the U.S. Capitol.</li><li>Facebook introduced emoji reactions in 2017, including the angry emoji. The following year, internal research found that posts that elicited high numbers of angry emojis were more likely to include “civic low quality news, civic misinfo, civic toxicity, health misinfo, and health antivax content.” Reducing its weight limited the spread of such content, and surveys showed that users didn’t like to see it attached to their posts. Recently the company cut its value to zero.</li></ul><p><strong>Turning points:</strong> Early on, Facebook’s recommendation algorithm prioritized updates from friends, such as a new photo or change in relationship status. In the early 2010s, the company tweaked it to favor likes and clicks. To counteract the resulting flood of clickbait, it was adjusted to promote posts from professional news media. In 2018, the company made changes to promote interaction between users by favoring reaction emojis, long comments, and reshares. This shift displayed more posts from friends and family but led to a surge of divisive content, prompting new rounds of changes in recent months.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Facebook’s membership of nearly 3 billion monthly active users famously exceeds the populations of the largest countries. What information it distributes, and to whom, has consequences that span personal, national, and global spheres. Both users and watchdogs need to understand how the company decides what to promote and what to suppress. Revealing all the details would invite people to game the algorithm, but some degree of transparency is necessary to avoid dire impacts including <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_jBiBIcM1il6lj7UckpMdiJVS-UroVO2A8HqlHVWB2YwTE2EinyOsLMj2u5SytA1gn8atm\" rel=\"noopener\">suicides</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-services-are-used-to-spread-religious-hatred-in-india-internal-documents-show-11635016354?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_jBiBIcM1il6lj7UckpMdiJVS-UroVO2A8HqlHVWB2YwTE2EinyOsLMj2u5SytA1gn8atm\" rel=\"noopener\">pogroms</a>.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Internet companies routinely experiment with new features to understand how they contribute to their business. But Facebook’s own research told the company that what was good for its bottom line was poisonous for society. The company hasn’t been able to strike a healthy balance on its own.

Google's move to design its own chips mimics Apple's decision to do the same over a decade ago. Both companies continue to use Qualcomm chips for cellular communications.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Advances in chip design and manufacturing are enticing companies with special processing needs to roll their own. Google tailored Tensor to suit its own AI technology while cutting its dependence on an outside supplier. That’s sure to help it make distinctive products. Look for more of the same from makers of all kinds of AI hardware.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Google controls the Android operating system. The more tightly it binds Tensor and Android, the greater the incentive it has to sell the chip to phone markers, and the harder it will be for Qualcomm and others to compete on performing inference in Android phones.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <strong><a href=\"http://deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></strong></h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table class=\"hse-image-wrapper\" role=\"presentation\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px !important;\"><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(59, 59, 59); word-break: break-word; text-align: center; padding: 5px 0px 10px; font-size: 0px;\"><img alt=\"The Batch Image-3\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/5871640/hubfs/The%20Batch%20Image-3.png?upscale=true&amp;width=1200&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=The%20Batch%20Image-3.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"middle\" class=\"stretch-on-mobile\" style=\"outline: none; text-decoration: none; max-width: 100%; font-size: 16px;\"></td></tr></tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Have you checked out the updated <em>Natural Language Processing Specialization</em>?

For instance, MERLOT answered multiple-choice questions about the action performed in a clip with 94.0 percent accuracy versus the previous best score of 82.8 percent accuracy. In other areas, the improvement was less dramatic. For example, on <a href=\"https://dramaqa.snu.ac.kr/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_jBiBIcM1il6lj7UckpMdiJVS-UroVO2A8HqlHVWB2YwTE2EinyOsLMj2u5SytA1gn8atm\" rel=\"noopener\">Drama-QA</a>, it answered multiple-choice questions about the story in clips from a TV show with 81.4 percent accuracy versus the previous best score of 81.0 accuracy.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> MERLOT learned to pack a range of essential information about video images, accompanying text, and frame order into the representations it generated.

They gathered similar slices of 33 paintings by other artists for a total of 17,520 training images and trained a convolutional neural network to classify whether or not a slice was painted by da Vinci.</li><li>After training the CNN, they trained a linear model to decide, based on the CNN’s classifications of slices, whether a given painting was created by da Vinci. The system accurately determined that Seated Bacchus, a painting once thought to have been painted by da Vinci but now attributed to a protégé, was not the master’s work.</li><li>By taking into account the classification of each slice of a given painting and their overlap, the researchers created heatmaps that showed areas most (shaded red) and least (shaded blue) likely to have been painted by da Vinci. This analysis showed that Leonardo da Vinci likely did not paint <em>Salvator Mundi</em>’s background or the figure’s raised right hand, but did paint its face and some of its body.</li><li>Art Recognition, whose method appears to work in a similar way based on an unpublished description they provided to <em>The Batch</em>, trained its system on a mixture of 2,392 image segments drawn from works by Rubens and other artists. It determined with 91.78 percent accuracy that <em>Samson and Delilah</em> was not painted by Rubens.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> <em>Salvator Mundi</em> was painted in the early 1500s and thought destroyed around a century later. The heavily damaged painting resurfaced in London in 1948. Experts there determined it was painted by one of da Vinci’s pupils, and it sold at auction for less than $50. After another sale, for $10,000 in 2005, evidence obtained during restoration convinced experts that it was an authentic da Vinci. It sold at auction for $450 million in 2017.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Fine art is a big business, and so is art fraud. Human experts often disagree in their assessments — and it may be impossible to establish the provenance of some works with complete certainty — but neural networks can supplement their judgments.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> If a human and a neural network disagreed about who created a picture, we’d just call it a draw.</p>","comment_id":"6182f3a3f6202b003b7ade83","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2021/11/Andres-w-letter-1.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2021-11-03T13:40:03.000-07:00","updated_at":"2022-10-05T15:17:31.000-07:00","published_at":"2021-11-03T12:00:00.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"Dear friends,\nYears ago, whenever I had to do something boring or unpleasant — such as drive to work or go for a run — I used to listen to music to provide a distraction.
