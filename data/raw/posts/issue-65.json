When your model outperforms humans, you can argue that you’ve reached a significant milestone and publish a paper! But when building production systems, I’ve found that the goal of exceeding HLP isn’t always as useful. I believe the time has come to rethink it.</em></p><p><em>Landing AI, where I’m CEO, has been automating visual inspection for manufacturers. We’ve built computer vision systems that can look at photos of products on an assembly line and classify defects such as scratches and dents. But we’ve run into an interesting challenge: Human experts don’t always agree on the appropriate label to describe the damage. “Is this really a scratch?” If even human experts disagree on a label, what is an AI system to do?</em></p><p><em>In the past, when I built speech recognition systems, I encountered a similar problem. In some audio clips, the person speaking mumbles, or noise in the background overwhelms their words. Despite several listens, no human can transcribe them with confidence.  Even when the words spoken are clear, transcriptions can be inconsistent. Is the correct transcription, “Um, today’s weather,” or “Erm . . . today’s weather”? If humans transcribe the same speech in different ways, how is a speech recognition system supposed to choose among the options?</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/unnamed-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Different defects on a platform\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><em>In academic research, we often test AI using a benchmark dataset with (noisy) labels. If a human achieves 90 percent accuracy measured against those labels and our model achieves 91 percent, we can celebrate beating HLP!</em></p><p><em>But when building commercial systems, I’ve found this concept to be only occasionally useful. For example, if an X-ray diagnosis system outperforms human radiologists, does that prove — via incontrovertible logic — that hospital administrators should use it? Hardly. In practice, hospital administrators care about more than beating HLP on test-set accuracy. They also care about safety, bias, performance on rare classes, and other factors on which beating HLP isn’t feasible. So even if you beat HLP on test-set accuracy, your system isn’t necessarily superior to what humans do in the real world.</em></p><p><em>I’ve found that there are better ways to use the concept of HLP. Briefly, our goal as machine learning engineers should be to raise, rather than beat, HLP. I’ll expand on that thought in a future letter.</em></p><p><em>Working on visual inspection, my team has developed a lot of insights into applications of AI in this domain. I’ll keep sharing insights that are generally useful for machine learning practitioners here and in DeepLearning.AI’s courses.

It analyzed 500,000 posts and found that challenger Joe Biden was more closely associated with words like “hope” and “success,” while incumbent Donald Trump was often mentioned alongside words like “fear” and “hatred.” Ranking these words according to their emotional intensity and frequency, the system <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/10/14/polls-trump-biden-presidential-race-artificial-intelligence/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">predicted</a> that Biden would win the popular vote by 2.9 percentage points.

It used the popularity of a given user or hashtag as a proxy for a subset of the voting population and scored positive or negative sentiment using an LSTM-based model to predict each candidate’s chance of victory. In July, it predicted Biden would win the popular vote by 8 to 9 percent — nearly triple the actual measure as of November 11 — and wrongly predicted the outcome in several swing states.</li><li><a href=\"https://advancedsymbolics.com/us-election-2/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Advanced Symbolics</a> parsed public data from Facebook and Twitter to create a list of 288,659 users it considered a representative sample of U.S. voters. Its method relied on linking the way people talked about certain issues, like crime or Covid-19, to a certain candidate. The company predicted that Biden would sweep the electoral college with 372 electoral votes. The democratic nominee has gained 279 electoral votes as of November 11.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> AI systems have made more accurate political predictions in the past.

You start with the pieces on the board (assumptions) and make a sequence of moves (steps) to reach a conclusion (theorem). <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">AlphaGo</a> famously beat world champions of the strategy game Go by iteratively building a tree of possible sequences of moves to find a winner. Similarly, GPT-f builds a tree of possible steps to prove a theorem.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> GPT-f is based on transformers similar to GPT-2 and GPT-3. It outputs pairs of statements (vertices) and steps (edges) in syntax readable by <a href=\"http://us.metamath.org/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Metamath Proof Explorer</a>, an automated proof verifier, and assembles them into a tree. The authors pretrained it on web data scraped by <a href=\"https://commoncrawl.org/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Common Crawl</a> — the corpus of choice for GPT-3 — as well as arXiv, Github, and Mathematics StackExchange to strengthen its sense of logic. They fine-tuned it on existing proofs verified by Metamath to give it familiarity with that system’s syntax.</p><ul><li>Given a set of assumptions and a statement to prove (called the goal in the figure above), GPT-f generates a candidate for the next statement (the next goal) and steps that prove it (the tactic). For instance, to prove the theorem (A ⇒ B), the model may first prove the tactic (A ⇒ C) and then attempt the next goal (C ⇒ B). It produces up to 32 next-goal and tactic candidates.</li><li>The system uses each next-goal candidate to build a tree of statements provable from the assumptions. If one of those statements is the original goal, then GPT-f has produced a proof.</li><li>The authors used Metamath to label each step correct or incorrect. They fed back Metamath-verified GPT-f proofs into the fine-tuning dataset. As GPT-f generated its shortest proof of a given theorem, it learned to create even shorter ones.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers compared GPT-f to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07019?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">MetaGen-IL</a>, a recurrent neural network and the previous state-of-the-art theorem prover that uses Metamath syntax. Given a test set of theorems proved by Metamath, GPT-f generated valid proofs for 56.22 percent of them, MetaGen-IL 21.16 percent. Active members in the Metamath community were <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/metamath/c/-FNsw2wyllI?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">impressed</a> by the economy of GPT-f’s proofs. The model shortened 23 previously verified proofs, which are now part of Metamath’s proof library.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Historically, AI has suffered from a gulf between deep learning and traditional symbolic approaches. This work shows that a sufficiently sophisticated neural network can manipulate symbols and logic as well.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> If this model were to find a solution to the <a href=\"https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Millennium Problem</a>, the authors could add $1 million to the training budget.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-optimize-2-1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Forbidden sign appearing over two cows \" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"got-model\">Got Model?</h3><p>Who needs cows when you can make milk from scratch?<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> NotMilk, a dairy-free milk substitute that was designed with help from a deep learning model, made its debut in American grocery stores, the <em><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/plant-based-milk-built-by-machine-learning-hits-whole-foods-shelves-11604572200?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Wall Street Journal</a></em> reports.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Chilean food-tech startup <a href=\"https://notco.com/about-us?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">NotCo</a> developed a model called Giuseppe that finds combinations of plant products that mimic the characteristics of animal-derived foods.
