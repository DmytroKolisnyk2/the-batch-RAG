A lot of early work in natural language processing (NLP) was funded by U.S. military intelligence agencies that needed machine translation and speech recognition capabilities. Then, as now, such agencies analyzed large volumes of text and recorded speech in various languages. They poured money into research in machine translation and speech recognition over decades, which motivated researchers to give these applications disproportionate attention relative to other uses of NLP.</em><br><br><em>This explains why many important technical breakthroughs in NLP stem from studying translation — more than you might imagine based on the modest role that translation plays in current applications. For instance, the celebrated transformer paper, “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--d4Gc6q514bW8fwBxNiIMuQo8hwMPODu9gBeKuJ1pNXfxdleVVivXQC1ffMrjG9lTZEabv\" rel=\"noopener\">Attention is All You Need</a>” by the Google Brain team, introduced a technique for mapping a sentence in one language to a translation in another. This laid the foundation for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, which map a prompt to a generated response.</em></p><p><em>Or consider the <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/lecture/nlp-sequence-models/bleu-score-(optional)-kC2HD?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--d4Gc6q514bW8fwBxNiIMuQo8hwMPODu9gBeKuJ1pNXfxdleVVivXQC1ffMrjG9lTZEabv\" rel=\"noopener\">BLEU score</a>, which is occasionally still used to evaluate LLMs by comparing their outputs to ground-truth examples. It was developed in 2002 to measure how well a machine-generated translation compares to a ground truth, human-created translation.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/08/unnamed--49--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/unnamed--49--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/unnamed--49--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/08/unnamed--49--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>A key component of LLMs is tokenization, the process of breaking raw input text into sub-word components that become the tokens to be processed. For example, the first part of the previous sentence may be divided into tokens like this:</em></p><p><em>/A /key /component /of /LL/Ms/ is/ token/ization</em></p><p><em>The most widely used tokenization algorithm for text today is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which gained popularity in NLP after a 2015 <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--d4Gc6q514bW8fwBxNiIMuQo8hwMPODu9gBeKuJ1pNXfxdleVVivXQC1ffMrjG9lTZEabv\" rel=\"noopener\">paper</a> by Sennrich et al. BPE starts with individual characters as tokens and repeatedly merges tokens that occur together frequently. Eventually, entire words as well as common sub-words become tokens. How did this technique come about? The authors wanted to build a model that could translate words that weren’t represented in the training data. They found that splitting words into sub-words created an input representation that enabled the model, if it had seen “token” and “ization,” to guess the meaning of a word it might not have seen before, such as “tokenization.”</em></p><p><em>I don’t intend this description of NLP history as advocacy for military-funded research. (I have accepted military funding, too. Some of my early work in deep learning at Stanford University was funded by DARPA, a U.S. defense research agency. This led directly to my starting Google Brain.) War is a horribly ugly business, and I would like there to be much less of it. Still, I find it striking that basic research in one area can lead to broadly beneficial developments in others. In similar ways, research into space travel led to LED lights and solar panels, experiments in particle physics led to magnetic resonance imaging, and studies of bacteria’s defenses against viruses led to the CRISPR gene-editing technology.</em></p><p><em>So it’s especially exciting to see so much basic research going on in so many different areas of AI. Who knows, a few years hence, what today’s experiments will yield?</em></p><p><em>Keep learning!</em></p><p><em>Andrew</em></p><p><em>P.S.

You can see MAV3D’s output <a href=\"https://make-a-video3d.github.io/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--d4Gc6q514bW8fwBxNiIMuQo8hwMPODu9gBeKuJ1pNXfxdleVVivXQC1ffMrjG9lTZEabv\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Earlier work known as <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-dreamfusion-generates-3d-images-from-text/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">DreamFusion</a> learned to produce a 3D scene from text by setting up a feedback loop between a pretrained diffusion text-to-image generator, which creates 2D images according to a text prompt, and a NeRF, which takes embeddings of points in space and learns to produce a 3D scene (mesh, point colors, and point transparencies) to match the 2D images shot from various angles. (NeRF can also generate images of the scene.) Basically, (i) the NeRF generated 2D images of a random 3D scene; (ii) the images — with added noise — were given as input to the diffusion text-to-image generator, which sharpened them according to the text prompt; and (iii) the NeRF used the sharpened images to sharpen the 3D scene, repeating the cycle. MAV3D worked the same way but (a) used a more computationally efficient embedding method called HexPlane, (b) swapped the pretrained text-to-image generator for a pretrained text-to-video generator, and (c) modified the NeRF to generate sequences of video frames. The resulting system takes a text prompt and learns to generate a matching 3D scene that changes over time.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> MAV3D is an animated version of the earlier DreamFusion, as described above. It includes the following models: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09632?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--d4Gc6q514bW8fwBxNiIMuQo8hwMPODu9gBeKuJ1pNXfxdleVVivXQC1ffMrjG9lTZEabv\" rel=\"noopener\">HexPlane</a> (which efficiently represents an animated 3D scene), <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14792?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--d4Gc6q514bW8fwBxNiIMuQo8hwMPODu9gBeKuJ1pNXfxdleVVivXQC1ffMrjG9lTZEabv\" rel=\"noopener\">Make-A-Video</a> (a text-to-video generator pretrained on LAION-5B text/image pairs and fine-tuned on 20 million videos), and a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--d4Gc6q514bW8fwBxNiIMuQo8hwMPODu9gBeKuJ1pNXfxdleVVivXQC1ffMrjG9lTZEabv\" rel=\"noopener\">NeRF</a> modified for video/animation.</p><ul><li>HexPlane learned an embedding for each point on each 2D plane in an animated 3D scene (xy, xz, xt, yz, yt, and zt) over 16 video frames. Given a point (three spatial dimensions plus time), the model projected it onto each plane, retrieved the corresponding embeddings, and concatenated them to produce a point embedding.</li><li>Given the embeddings and a random camera position per frame, NeRF produced a video.</li><li>The system added noise to the NeRF video and fed it to Make-A-Video. Given a text prompt, Make-A-Video estimated what the video would look like without the noise.</li><li>The loss function minimized the difference between the NeRF video and Make-A-Video’s denoised version to update HexPlane and NeRF.</li><li>The system cycled through this process 12,000 times using a different random camera trajectory each time, which enabled it to evaluate every point from multiple angles.</li><li>The authors extracted from NeRF a 64-frame animated 3D scene using the <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/37402.37422?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--d4Gc6q514bW8fwBxNiIMuQo8hwMPODu9gBeKuJ1pNXfxdleVVivXQC1ffMrjG9lTZEabv\">marching cubes</a> algorithm.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> No other system generates animated 3D scenes from text, so the authors compared MAV3D with systems that solve two sub-tasks, generating 3D static scenes from text and generating videos from text. They used <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=bKBhQhPeKaF&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--d4Gc6q514bW8fwBxNiIMuQo8hwMPODu9gBeKuJ1pNXfxdleVVivXQC1ffMrjG9lTZEabv\" rel=\"noopener\">CLIP R-Precision</a>, a metric that evaluates the similarity between an image and a text description (higher is better), to measure the systems’ performance averaged across a number of images taken from different angles (for 3D scenes) or images over time (for videos). MAV3D outperformed a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--d4Gc6q514bW8fwBxNiIMuQo8hwMPODu9gBeKuJ1pNXfxdleVVivXQC1ffMrjG9lTZEabv\" rel=\"noopener\">Stable Diffusion</a> implementation of DreamFusion (82.4 CLIP R-Precision versus 66.1 CLIP R-Precision). However, it did worse than Make-A-Video (79.2 CLIP R-Precision versus 86.6 CLIP R-Precision).</p><p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Examples of MAV3D’s output include very short scenes of varying quality. The system allows only one color per point so, for instance, reflective surfaces look the same regardless of viewing angle. It’s also computationally demanding: It took 6.5 hours per scene using eight A100 GPUs.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Adapting NeRF for video/animation is exciting, but the larger lesson is that finding an efficient way to learn representations — HexPlane in this case — can make tasks feasible that otherwise would require impractical amounts of computation.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> While MAV3D’s rendering would be improved by variable colors to represent reflections, shadows, and dynamic lighting, its strong performance relative to DreamFusion suggests a way to improve text-to-3D: train on videos instead of images. Videos contain moving objects and sometimes changing camera positions, so they can depict more diverse 3D geometry than a set of static images. Learning from videos could avoid generating 3D images that look fine from only <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1578040812088479744?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--d4Gc6q514bW8fwBxNiIMuQo8hwMPODu9gBeKuJ1pNXfxdleVVivXQC1ffMrjG9lTZEabv\" rel=\"noopener\">one angle at a time</a>.</p>","comment_id":"64ef7dee10a5d2000149ac64","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2023/08/unnamed--49-.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2023-08-30T10:35:42.000-07:00","updated_at":"2023-08-30T12:24:30.000-07:00","published_at":"2023-08-30T12:24:30.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"The Batch - AI News & Insights: I’d like to share a part of the origin story of large language models that isn’t widely known.
