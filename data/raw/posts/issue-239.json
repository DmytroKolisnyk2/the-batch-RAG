It’s cheap to fetch a webpage, and if your agent chooses poorly and reads the wrong page, there’s little harm done. In comparison, sending a product or moving a physical robot are costly actions, which makes it hard to experiment rapidly. Similarly, agents that generate code (that you can run in a sandbox environment) are relatively cheap to run, leading to rapid experimentation and progress.&nbsp;<br><br>Although today’s research agents, whose tasks are mainly to gather and synthesize information, are still in an early phase of development, I expect to see rapid improvements. ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Gemini can already browse the web, but their online research tends to be limited; this helps them get back to users quickly. But I look forward to the next generation of agents that can spend minutes or perhaps hours doing deep research before getting back to you with an output. Such algorithms will be able to generate much better answers than models that fetch only one or two pages before returning an answer.<br><br>Even when experimentation is quick, evaluation remains a bottleneck in development. If you can try out 10 algorithm variations quickly, how do you actually pick among them? Using an LLM to evaluate another LLM's output is common practice, but prompting an LLM to give very accurate and consistent evaluations of text output is a challenge.

Given a set of reagents and resulting product, RoboChem aimed to find conditions that maximize the yield (the ratio of the amount of a product synthesized to the potential amount, expressed as a percentage) and throughput (rate of synthesis) in the fewest experimental runs. It followed a 3-part cycle: (i) determine experimental conditions (amounts and concentrations of the given reagents, intensity of light, and time spent in the reactor), (ii) combine the reagents under those conditions, and (iii) evaluate the yield and throughput via a spectrometer.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>RoboChem learned how to find the best conditions for each reaction using a Gaussian process, which provides a function and uncertainty estimate for variables to be maximized (in this case, yield and throughput) given the values of other variables (the experimental conditions). Given a set of reagents and 6 to 20 sets of random conditions, RoboChem ran the reactions, measured the results, and updated the Gaussian process.</li><li>RoboChem chose new conditions based on which parts of the Gaussian process’s function had the highest uncertainty and which parts were most likely to produce the highest yield and throughput. RoboChem ran the reaction, measured the results, and updated the Gaussian process.&nbsp;</li><li>It repeated this cycle until it achieved an author-defined throughput, yield, or number of experiments. It returned the conditions with the highest throughput and yield.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:&nbsp;</strong>Robochem&nbsp;executed reactions to produce 18 substances. In all cases, it found experimental conditions that had either higher throughput and yield, or higher throughput and nearly equivalent yield, than the best conditions previously known. In one reaction, RoboChem achieved yield of 58 percent and throughput of 95.6 g/Lh (gram yield per liter in the reactor per hour), while previous work had achieved 45 percent and 2.8 g/Lh. In another reaction, RoboChem achieved 81 percent and 1720 g/Lh, where previous best results achieved 82 percent and 3 g/Lh — 1 percent lower yield but 573 times greater throughput.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong>&nbsp;In 2020, researchers at the University of Liverpool&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/scientific-discovery-on-a-roll/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-87IEkio4ktkOH9VkmcWuq2BgtXjYHRZma0dP7QYPpRBg1l-KOxs3aG7c2Wnxp0D-BYC7sE\" rel=\"noopener\">trained</a>&nbsp;a mobile robot arm to navigate a chemistry lab, mix chemicals, and operate equipment.

They’re less adept at the more challenging tasks of multiplication and division of larger numbers. One way to perform these tasks well is to divide them into simpler subtasks. For example, a relatively easy way to multiply two large numbers like 123 and 321 is to&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Split one number into decimal places (123 becomes 100 + 20 + 3)</li><li>Multiply the other number by each of these (100 * 321 + 20 * 321 + 3 * 321)</li><li>Add the resulting products to arrive at the solution (32100 + 6420 + 963 = 39483)</li></ul><p>A similar technique exists for division. Together, these approaches can enable LLMs to perform more complicated mathematical tasks.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors built GOAT (a model GOod at Arithmetic Tasks) by fine-tuning&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-87IEkio4ktkOH9VkmcWuq2BgtXjYHRZma0dP7QYPpRBg1l-KOxs3aG7c2Wnxp0D-BYC7sE\" rel=\"noopener\">LLaMA</a>&nbsp;on a synthetic dataset that comprised 1 million examples of arithmetic operations on integers that were divided into steps for easier calculation.</p><ul><li>The prompts were simple instructions like “Calculate 397 x 4429” or “I would appreciate it if you could assist me in calculating 1463456 + 2107”.</li><li>The answers were either numbers (for the simpler operations) or chains of reasoning (for multiplications and divisions of larger numbers). For example, if the prompt was “Calculate 24x79”, the target was “24 * 79 = 24 * (70 + 9) = 24 * 70 + 24 * 9 = 1680 + 216 = 1896”.</li><li>To create these chains, the authors wrote a Python script. For multiplication, the script randomly generated two numbers, split one number into decimal places, multiplied the second number by each of those terms, then added the products. It followed a similar procedure for division.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors compared GOAT and GPT-4 on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-87IEkio4ktkOH9VkmcWuq2BgtXjYHRZma0dP7QYPpRBg1l-KOxs3aG7c2Wnxp0D-BYC7sE\" rel=\"noopener\">BIGBench</a>, which contains arithmetic operations on integers up to five digits. GOAT performed either on par with or better than GPT-4 for all operations. Specifically, GPT-4 struggled to multiply and divide large numbers. Multiplying 5-digit numbers, GPT-4 achieved 0 percent accuracy, while GOAT achieved 96.7 percent. Dividing five-digit numbers, GPT-4 achieved 53.4 percent, while GOAT achieved 96.5 percent. GOAT also performed better than other LLMs (Bloom, GPT-NeoX, OPT, and Pythia) that had been fine-tuned in the same way. The authors attribute this to the fact that LLaMA generates a separate token for each digit (and does not learn tokens that represent multiple digits), while the other models learn tokens for multiple digits (for example, separate tokens for 748, 74, and 7).</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;LLMs have latent mathematical knowledge that can be unlocked by thoughtful fine-tuning.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Humans, too, aren’t great at multiplying or dividing numbers directly — but give us a pencil and paper so we can work things out step by step, and we’re much better.</p><hr><h1 id=\"data-points\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/tag/data-points/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Data Points</a></h1><p>More AI news of the week includes:&nbsp;</p><p>🔊 Adobe previews an AI audio tool&nbsp;<br>💰 Microsoft launches Copilot for Finance<br>🐋 AI uncovers reasons behind humpback whale deaths</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/data-points-issue-239/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Read Data Points here.</a></p>","comment_id":"65e8db24893f37000157e17b","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/03/MULTIAGENTS2.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2024-03-06T13:07:48.000-08:00","updated_at":"2024-03-06T14:32:42.000-08:00","published_at":"2024-03-06T13:22:45.000-08:00","custom_excerpt":"The Batch AI News and Insights: Progress on LLM-based agents that can autonomously plan out and execute sequences of actions has been rapid, and I continue to see month-over-month improvements.
