Suppose we define a robot as self-aware if it can recognize itself in the mirror, which seems a natural way to test a robot’s awareness of itself.

There isn’t widespread agreement on these terms. For example, do all living things have souls? How about a bacterium or virus?</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/unnamed--90--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"685\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/unnamed--90--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/unnamed--90--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/01/unnamed--90--1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>So even if someone comes up with a reasonable new scientific definition, many people — unaware of the new definition — will still understand the term based on their earlier understanding. Then, when media outlets start talking about how AI has met the definition, people won’t recognize that the hype refers to a narrow objective (like a robot recognizing itself in the mirror). Instead, they’ll think that AI accomplished what they generally associate with words like sentience.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Because of this, I have mixed feelings about attempts to come up with new definitions of artificial general intelligence (AGI). I believe that most people, including me, currently think of AGI as AI that can carry out any intellectual task that a human can. With this definition, I think we’re still at least decades away from AGI. This creates a temptation to define it using a lower bar, which would make it easier to declare success: The easiest way to achieve AGI might be to redefine what the term means!&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Should we work to clarify the meanings of ambiguous terms that relate to intelligence? In some cases, developing a careful definition and getting widespread agreement behind it could set a clear milestone for AI and help move the field forward.

LLMOps is a rapidly developing field that takes ideas from MLOps (machine learning operations) and specializes them for building and deploying LLM-based applications. In our new course, “LLMOps,” taught by Google Cloud’s Erwin Huizenga, you’ll learn how to use automation and experiment tracking to speed up development. Specifically, you’ll develop an LLMOps pipeline to automate LLM fine-tuning. By building a tuning pipeline and tracking the experiment artifacts — including the parameters, inputs, outputs, and experimental results — you can reduce manual steps in the development process, resulting in a more efficient workflow.

Neural demixing tools can separate vocals from music, but they tend to leave remnants of instruments in the resulting vocal track. A model trained on such tracks may learn to generate an accompaniment based on the remnants, not the voice. Then, given a pure vocal track, it can’t produce a coherent accompaniment. One way to address this issue is to add noise to the isolated voices. The noise drowns out the instrumental remnants and forces the model to learn from the voices.</p><p><strong>How it works:&nbsp;</strong>The authors based their approach on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03143?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_4zfBvV84quJyYowB_7sImvE4t7Wffz-45FHrPoTz2URuxI_3N0s5Ws1yVPgIbfLJR1T6h\" rel=\"noopener\">AudioLM</a>, a system that generates audio by attending to both small- and large-scale features.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The authors built a dataset of 1 million recordings that totaled 46,000 hours of music.
