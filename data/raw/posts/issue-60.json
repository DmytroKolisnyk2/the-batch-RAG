But typical tactics like blurring faces and distorting voices can make it hard for audiences to connect emotionally.

Their images were captured using an array of nine cameras.</li><li>The filmmakers blurred the faces deliberately to signal to the audience that identities were hidden.</li></ul><p><strong>What they’re saying:</strong> “This technology allowed us to just stretch the faces . . . over the images that I shot in the film. The face moves exactly the same way. It smiles, it cries in exactly the same way, but it is somebody else’s face.” — David France, director of “Welcome to Chechnya,” in <em><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/welcome-to-chechnya-david-france-hbo-1234693891/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a></em>.</p><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> An <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ddc3c69f338b31c0a68c9db/t/5ebd6a71061edc10b1813a2d/1589471859129/Welcome+to+Chechnya+Final+Press+Notes+MAY+2020.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">estimated</a> 40,000 gay men and women live in Chechnya.

Called natural turn-taking, the skill should be available next year.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> Natural turn-taking fuses analyses of data from the microphone and camera in devices like the Echo Show, Echo Look, and Echo Spot.</p><ul><li>To determine whether a user is speaking to Alexa, the system passes photos of the speaker through a pose detection algorithm to see which way they’re facing. It also <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02504?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">passes the voice recording</a> through an LSTM that extracts features and a speech recognition model to decide whether the words were directed at the device. It fuses the models’ outputs to make a determination.</li><li>The new skill also makes Alexa more responsive to interruptions. For instance, if a user asks for a Bruce Springsteen song and then says, “Play Charlie Parker instead,” Alexa can pivot from the Boss to the Bird.</li><li>The skill understands indirect requests, like when a user butts in with “That one” while Alexa is reading a list of take-out restaurants. The system time-stamps such interruptions to figure out what the user was referring to, then passes that information to a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.science/blog/science-innovations-power-alexa-conversations-dialogue-management?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">dialogue manager</a> model to formulate a response.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> In conversation, people interrupt, talk over one another, and rarely use each other’s names. Making conversational interactions with AI more fluid could be handy in a wide variety of settings.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Alexa now tolerates users interrupting it. Will users eventually tolerate Alexa interrupting them?</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-gif-maker208-1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"ezgif.com-gif-maker (8)-1\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Courses 1 and 2 of our brand-new Generative Adversarial Networks Specialization are available on Coursera! <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">Enroll now</a></p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-gif-maker205-1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Graphs and data related to RubiksShift\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"more-efficient-action-recognition\">More Efficient Action Recognition</h3><p>Recognizing actions performed in a video requires understanding each frame and relationships between the frames. Previous research devised a way to analyze individual images efficiently known as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07370?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Active Shift Layer</a> (ASL). New research extends this technique to the steady march of video frames.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Led by Linxi Fan and Shyamal Buch, the Stanford Vision and Learning Lab, University of Texas Austin, and Nvidia developed <a href=\"https://stanfordvl.github.io/rubiksnet-site//assets/eccv20.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">RubiksShift</a>, an efficient replacement for convolutional layers when processing time-series inputs. The name’s similarity to <a href=\"https://www.rubiks.com/en-us/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Rubik’s Cube</a> apparently refers to extracting features by shifting three-dimensional data.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> A shift filter is a variation on the convolutional filter that generates only values of 0 or 1. This is more computationally efficient than traditional convolution, which generates real-valued outputs, but it prevents backpropagation, which makes shift filters difficult to train. ASL reformulated backprop for shift filters applied to still images. RubiksShift adapts ASL to video by generalizing it for an additional dimension; in this case, time.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> 3D convolutional filters typically are used to process images in the three dimensions: red, blue, and green. For videos, a time is added. RubiksShift is a layer of 4D shift convolutions. The researchers also propose an architecture, RubiksNet, composed of multiple RubiksShift layers.</p><ul><li>Shift filters effectively translate inputs in a certain direction. Applied to images, they change the center (without stretching or rotation). Applied to videos, they change the center of individual frames and move data within them forward or backward in time (within the confines of the frame rate).</li><li>ASL trains shift filters by introducing two parameters that determine the translation of pixels vertically and horizontally. It allows the parameters to be non-integers, but it averages them. For instance, a half-pixel shift to the right is equivalent to the average of the original position and the one to its right.</li><li>RubiksShift adds a third parameter that represents the shift across time. It forces the parameters to converge to integer values during training, so there’s no need to average them at test time.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors evaluated RubiksNet against state-of-the-art action recognition networks designed for efficient computation, such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07750?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">I3D</a>, using the <a href=\"https://20bn.com/datasets/something-something/v1?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Something-Something</a> dataset of clips that represent human actions. RubiksNet achieved top-1 accuracy of 46.5 percent compared to I3D’s 45.8 percent, and it executed 10 times fewer floating point operations during classification. RubiksNet more than doubled the accuracy of other methods that used a similar number of operations.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Video is ubiquitous, and we could do a lot more with it — in terms of search, manipulation, generation, and so on — if machines had better ways to understand it. <br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Hopefully reading this overview of RubiksNet was less confusing than trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-resize2019.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Google tumor detector\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"standards-for-testing-medical-ai\">Standards for Testing Medical AI</h3><p>New guidelines for reporting on experiments with medical AI aim to ensure that such research is transparent, rigorous, and reliable.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30219-3/fulltext?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Spirit-AI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1034-x?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">Consort-AI</a> are complementary protocols designed to improve the quality of clinical trials for AI-based interventions.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The guidelines are intended to address concerns of doctors, regulators, and funders of technologies such as the Google tumor detector shown above.</p><ul><li>Spirit-AI calls for clinical trials to observe established best practices in medicine.
