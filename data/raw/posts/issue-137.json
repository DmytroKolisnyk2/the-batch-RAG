People rarely mistreat others who have power over them -- for example, their boss — because they might suffer adverse consequences. But when you encounter someone whom you can either push down or lift up, with no risk of harm or possibility of gain, your choice reveals your character.</em><br><br><em>Similarly, the way a nation treats those with less power — specifically refugees — shows its character. As Russia continues to attack Ukraine, millions of refugees are streaming across Europe. They join refugees from Afghanistan, Syria, Congo, Myanmar, Iraq and other nations in seeking safety. I’ve been heartened by news that Poland, Romania, Moldova, Hungary, Germany, France, Ireland, the United Kingdom and other countries are offering them a safe haven. I hope the U.S. will open its doors wider to all refugees.</em><br><br><em>Historically, refugees have made rich contributions to their host nations. The U.S. would have been a very different country without Albert Einstein, Madeleine Albright, and Sergey Brin, all of whom were refugees. Countries that welcome refugees today may find tomorrow that they’ve adopted the next Einstein, yielding great prestige and prosperity.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-4-1.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Excerpt from &quot;The New Colossus&quot; by Emma Lazarus, cast in a plaque\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-4-1.webp 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-4-1.webp 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-4-1.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Of course, integrating refugees is not a trivial matter. They must adjust to a new home, their host country must adapt to a more diverse population, and local people may worry about competition for jobs and resources. But the need to welcome people fleeing for their lives is pressing. Surely we can find it in ourselves to share with those who have lost everything.</em><br><br><em>Treating people well regardless of their power should be a key part of building in AI as well.

At the same time, let’s help Russian engineers who don’t support the war and want to emigrate and build a new life in a different country.</em><br><br><em>When developers write software, there’s an economic temptation to focus on serving people who have power: How can one show users of a website who have purchasing power an advertisement that motivates them to click?

However, real-world markets tend to be too complex to be modeled by interactions among individual agents. Instead of simulating market participants, a cGAN can model aggregated sales and purchases in each slice of time.<br><br><strong>Conditional GAN basics:</strong> Given a random input, a typical GAN learns to produce realistic output through competition between a discriminator that judges whether output is synthetic or real and a generator that aims to fool the discriminator.

Then they added orders by an independent trader.</p><ul><li>The authors simulated the stock market as a whole by connecting these components in a feedback loop. The first time through the loop, the exchange received historical buy and sell orders; subsequent times, it received orders from the agent and/or the cGAN.</li><li>The exchange paired offers with purchases. Then it sent details for each order (price, volume, buy or sell, and time since the previous trade) and the market as a whole (best price, highest volume, average price, and time when the details were calculated) to the cGAN.</li><li>Given the details provided by the exchange, the cGAN generated a new order along with a wait time. After waiting, it passed the order to the exchange, which triggered the cGAN to generate another order.</li><li>For a half-hour within a period of several hours, an independent agent sent its own purchases to the exchange. In each of 30 minutes, it observed the trading volume and issued a buy order based on its observation. The authors set the volume: 1, 10, or 25 percent of the observed volume.</li></ul><p><strong>Results</strong>: The authors checked statistical similarity between historical and cGAN orders in terms of price, volume, direction (buy or sell), and frequency distributions. In particular, they looked at Tesla shares on May 2 and May 3, 2019, and plotted the distributions. The real and synthetic distributions matched fairly closely. When they ran the simulation using historical orders plus cGAN orders, the price rose slightly during the 30 minutes when the agent would have been active. Given the orders generated by the cGAN and the agent, the price rose by an order of magnitude more and returned to normal shortly after the agent stopped trading, demonstrating the simulation’s response to the agent’s activity.<br><br><strong>Why it matters</strong>: GANs are usually associated with image generation.

The bulk of the money — $76.5 billion — came from China, the European Union, and the United States. It reached fewer recipients than in previous years: The number of new AI companies dropped from over 4,000 in 2017 to less than 750 in 2021.</li><li>Regulation is on the rise. Fifty-five AI-related laws have been enacted by 25 key countries since 2015. Eighteen were passed in 2021.</li><li>Despite simmering geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, in 2021, more than 9,000 publications came from teams that included members in both countries, a fivefold increase since 2010.</li><li>Training times and costs are falling for a wide range of tasks including image classification, object detection, and language processing. Image classification models were 63.3 percent less costly and 94.4 percent faster to train in 2021 than 2018.</li><li>Conferences focused on AI ethics received five times as many paper submissions in 2021 as they did in 2014. The percentage of ethics papers submitted by private-sector researchers during that period rose by 71 percent, reflecting mainstream adoption of ethical concerns.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Previous editions of the <em>AI Index</em> highlighted important inflection points in the industry’s growth.</p><ul><li>In <a href=\"https://aiindex.stanford.edu/ai-index-report-2021/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Ds2_1cOw3zTOmlZJno0Oqyuy6lwDuEbfvzZi-dhlWv6xSRh1TW9SAjlEhJ6vJ-7s4QQN8#individual-chapters\" rel=\"noopener\">2021</a>, the report highlighted the growing share of newly-minted doctoral degrees in AI.
