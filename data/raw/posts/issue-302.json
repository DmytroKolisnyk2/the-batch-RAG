I often speak with large companies’&nbsp;C-suite and Boards about AI strategy and implementation, and would like to share some ideas that are applicable to big companies. One key is to create an environment where small, scrappy teams don’t need permission to innovate. Let me explain.</p><p>Large companies are slower than startups for many reasons. But why are even 3-person, scrappy teams within large companies slower than startups of a similar size? One major reason is that large companies have more to lose, and cannot afford for a small team to build and ship a feature that leaks sensitive information, damages the company brand, hurts revenue, invites regulatory scrutiny, or otherwise damages an important part of the business. To prevent these outcomes, I have seen companies require privacy review, marketing review, financial review, legal review, and so on before a team can ship anything. But if engineers need sign-off from 5 vice presidents before they’re even allowed to launch an MVP (minimum viable product) to run an experiment, how can they ever discover what customers want, iterate quickly, or invent any meaningful new product?</p><p>Thanks to AI-assisted coding, the world now has a capability to build software prototypes really fast. But many large companies’ processes – designed to protect against legitimate downside risks – make them unable to take advantage of this capability. In contrast, in small startups with no revenue, no customers, and no brand reputation the downside is limited. In fact, going out of business is a very real possibility anyway, so moving fast makes a superior tradeoff to moving slowly to protect against downside risk. In the worst case, it might invent a new way to go out of business, but in a good case, it might become very valuable.</p><p>Fortunately, large companies have a way out of this conundrum. They can create a sandbox environment for teams to experiment in a way that strictly limits the downside risk. Then those teams can go much faster and not have to slow down to get anyone’s permission.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/unnamed--65--1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Cartoon: Woman at desk; man in sandbox with shovel saying, &quot;I'm experimenting!&quot; in office setting.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/unnamed--65--1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/unnamed--65--1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/unnamed--65--1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>The sandbox environment can be a set of written policies, not necessarily a software implementation of a sandbox. For example, it may permit a team to test the nascent product only on employees of the company and perhaps alpha testers who have signed an NDA, and give no access to sensitive information. It may be allowed to launch product experiments only under newly created brands not tied directly to the company. Perhaps it must operate within a pre-allocated budget for compute.</p><p>Within this sandbox, there can be broad scope for experimentation, and — importantly — a team is free to experiment without frequently needing to ask for permission, because the downside they can create is limited. Further, when a prototype shows sufficient promise to bring it to scale, the company can then invest in making sure the software is reliable, secure, treats sensitive information appropriately, is consistent with the company’s brand, and so on.</p><p>Under this framework, it is easier to build a company culture that encourages learning, building, and experimentation and celebrates even the inevitable failures that now come with modest cost. Dozens or hundreds of prototypes can be built and quickly discarded as part of the price of finding one or two ideas that turn out to be home runs.</p><p>Importantly, this also lets teams move quickly as they churn through those dozens of prototypes needed to get to the valuable ones.</p><p>I often speak with large companies about AI strategy and implementation. My quick checklist of things to consider is people, process, and platform. This letter has addressed only part of processes, with an emphasis on moving fast. I’m bullish about what both startups and large companies can do with AI, and I will write about the roles of people and platforms in future letters.</p><p>Keep building!</p><p>Andrew</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/reinforcement-fine-tuning-llms-grpo?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/05/V3_DeepLearning_Predibase_GRPO_Banner_2070x1080-01.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Promo banner for: &quot;Reinforcement Fine-Tuning LLMs with GRPO&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1043\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/V3_DeepLearning_Predibase_GRPO_Banner_2070x1080-01.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/V3_DeepLearning_Predibase_GRPO_Banner_2070x1080-01.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/V3_DeepLearning_Predibase_GRPO_Banner_2070x1080-01.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2025/05/V3_DeepLearning_Predibase_GRPO_Banner_2070x1080-01.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>In “Reinforcement Fine-Tuning LLMs with GRPO,” you’ll learn to fine-tune models using a scalable reinforcement learning algorithm that replaces human-labeled data with programmable rewards.

An update of OpenAI’s earlier Codex command-line software (Codex CLI), it uses agents to perform tasks such as writing code, running tests, and fixing bugs in parallel. Codex is available to users of ChatGPT Pro, Enterprise, and Team with Plus and Edu coming soon. A smaller version of the underlying model, called codex-mini-latest, is designed to work with Codex CLI and available via API for $1.50/$6.00 per 1 million tokens of input/output.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The model that underpins Codex is codex-1, a version of OpenAI’s top-of-the-line o3 reasoning model that was fine-tuned for software engineering. OpenAI trained the model on real-world coding tasks via reinforcement learning. Codex does not&nbsp;accept image input (say, a sketch of a user interface) or allow users to redirect an agent while it’s operating. OpenAI promises to add these features to a future version.</p><ul><li>Codex puts users in control of a team of software-development agents that operate directly on a user’s code repository (either locally or on GitHub) to improve code, build features, or make pull requests. The agents are confined to isolated, sandboxed containers so that they can’t interact with each other, access the internet, or otherwise compromise security.</li><li>Users can prompt agents to either write code or answer questions. A task may take as long as 30 minutes to complete depending on its complexity. After completing tasks, Codex provides footnotes including terminal logs, test results, and other evidence of its actions.&nbsp;</li><li>A file called AGENTS.md can modify agent behavior (like a README.md file, but for agents instead of humans). This file can specify how and when an agent makes pull requests, provide guidelines for coding style, or list tests to verify generated code.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;In OpenAI’s tests, the codex-1 model outperformed other OpenAI reasoning models without AGENTS.md files or additional scaffolding such as tools or test&nbsp;logic.</p><ul><li>Performing unspecified software-engineering tasks including generating software patches, codex-1 (75 percent accuracy) exceeded&nbsp;o3 set to high effort (70 percent accuracy) and o4-mini set to high effort (67 percent accuracy).</li><li>In tests of agentic software engineering in SWE-bench Verified, codex-1 (72.1 percent in 1 try, 83.8 percent in 8 tries), outperformed o3 set to high effort (69.7 percent in 1 try, 83.6 percent in 8 tries).</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong>&nbsp;Agentic coding tools have become a key&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/next-generation-coding-tools-empower-developers-with-agent-style-interactions/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--7oJ5fal9bcg90E77nuOMbT2YCw0PdrVJwU4Oh6tRyXVUMKqxuf-zjCiovY_fg-bVYa9Ug\" rel=\"noopener\">battleground</a>&nbsp;for AI providers in the past year.

Since matrix multiplications account for 95 percent of computation in LLM training, FP4 could significantly accelerate computation and reduce memory costs.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;Quantization functions, which accelerate computation by reducing the precision of model weights and layer outputs, make typical training impossible because they’re not differentiable.

A differentiable approximation of a quantization function enables quantization to reduce training computation while maintaining the accuracy of the trained model.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;The authors pretrained Llama 2 13B on 100 billion tokens of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11794?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--7oJ5fal9bcg90E77nuOMbT2YCw0PdrVJwU4Oh6tRyXVUMKqxuf-zjCiovY_fg-bVYa9Ug\" rel=\"noopener\">text scraped from the web</a>. They used FP4 for matrix multiplications and FP8, BF16, or FP16 for the other operations such as optimizer updates.</p><ul><li>To quantize the model weights to FP4 (which ranges between -6 and 6), the authors scaled the values in the weight matrices relative to the maximum absolute value. They computed the updates on a higher-precision copy of the weights, which made it necessary to re-quantize them at each training step during the forward pass through the network.</li><li>Although the weights had been quantized to 4 bits, matrix multiplication between the weights and outputs of the previous layer could produce values outside the FP4 range. So, in each layer, if a value exceeded the 99th percentile of the values of the layer’s input, the authors limited the input to the 99th-percentile value. Then they converted the layer’s inputs to FP4. Limiting outliers prevented high values from affecting the scaling during FP4 conversion.</li><li>Limiting outliers introduced a degree of error, so they computed a matrix to correct the result of the matrix multiplication. They computed this matrix in FP16 using sparse matrix multiplication between the weights and the outliers.</li><li>During backpropagation, the authors computed the gradients through a differentiable function that approximated the quantization function.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors simulated FP4 hardware on Nvidia H100 GPUs, which don’t directly support that number format. FP4 achieved accuracy similar to that of BF16 during training and across a wide variety of tasks at inference.</p><ul><li>On question-answering tasks, FP4 approached or outperformed BF16. Averaged across nine benchmarks including BoolQ (answering yes-no questions), HellaSwag (completing an incomplete narrative), and ARC-C (answering multiple-choice questions that involve reasoning), FP4 achieved 54.95 accuracy, while BF16 achieved 54.44 accuracy.</li><li>Specifically, on Hellaswag, FP4 training achieved 54.12 percent accuracy, while BF16 achieved 53.56 accuracy.</li><li>On BoolQ, FP4 achieved 55.90 percent accuracy, while BF16 achieved 57.40 accuracy.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Training LLMs at FP4 precision ought to reduce computation dramatically on hardware that supports FP4 matrix multiplications.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;FP4-ready hardware became available in the cloud only&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/blackwell-coreweave-gb200-nvl72-instances-cloud/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--7oJ5fal9bcg90E77nuOMbT2YCw0PdrVJwU4Oh6tRyXVUMKqxuf-zjCiovY_fg-bVYa9Ug\" rel=\"noopener\">early this year</a>, so the authors weren’t able to measure the actual acceleration.
