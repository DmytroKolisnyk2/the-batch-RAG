Many business and government leaders are gathered here again for the annual World Economic Forum to discuss tech, climate, geopolitics, and economic growth. While the vast majority of my conversations have been on AI business implementations and governance, I have also been speaking about our latest AI climate simulator and about geoengineering. After speaking about geoengineering onstage at multiple events to a total of several hundred people, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by almost uniformly positive reactions. You can play with our simulator&nbsp;<a href=\"http://planetparasol.ai/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9kgISsDFvuO8MZlBnFosRC4C4FiNqno6ahMESpHrnRkOKvDeon1AkJ43ZnkA-hwbA6vq6q\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p><p>Here’s why I think we should seriously consider geoengineering: The world urgently needs to reduce carbon emissions, but it hasn’t happened fast enough. Given recent emission trends, without geoengineering, there’s no longer any plausible path to keeping global warming to the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal set by the Paris agreement. Under reasonable assumptions, we are on a path to 2.5 degrees of warming or worse. We might be in for additional abrupt changes if we hit certain tipping points.</p><p>If you tilt a four-legged chair by a few degrees, it will fall back onto its four legs. But if you tip it far enough — beyond its “tipping point” — it will fall over with a crash. Climate tipping points are like that, where parts of our planet, warmed sufficiently, might reach a point where the planet reorganizes abruptly in a way that is impossible to reverse. Examples include a possible melting of the Arctic permafrost, which would release additional methane (a potent greenhouse gas), or a collapse of ocean currents that move warm water northward from the tropics (the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/amoc.html?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9kgISsDFvuO8MZlBnFosRC4C4FiNqno6ahMESpHrnRkOKvDeon1AkJ43ZnkA-hwbA6vq6q\" rel=\"noopener\">Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation</a>).</p><p>Keeping warming low will significantly lower the risk of hitting a tipping point. This is why the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2022/12/climate-tipping-points_9994de90/abc5a69e-en.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9kgISsDFvuO8MZlBnFosRC4C4FiNqno6ahMESpHrnRkOKvDeon1AkJ43ZnkA-hwbA6vq6q\" rel=\"noopener\">OECD’s report</a>&nbsp;states, “the existence of climate system tipping points means it is vital to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C, with no or very limited overshoot.”</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/unnamed--46-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Global temperature change map and graph comparing scenarios with and without SAI intervention.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/unnamed--46-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/unnamed--46-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/unnamed--46-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>The good news is that geoengineering keeps the 1.5 degree goal alive.

For example, just as global warming has had uneven regional effects, the global cooling impact will also be uneven. But on average, a planet with 1.5 degrees of warming would be much more livable than one with 2.5 degrees (or more). Further, after collaborating extensively with climate scientists on AI climate models and examining the output of multiple such models, I believe the risks associated with cooling down our planet will be much lower than the risks of runaway climate change.</p><p>I hope we can build a global governance structure to decide collectively whether, and if so to what extent and how, to implement geoengineering. For example, we might start with small scale experiments (aiming for &lt;&lt;0.1 degrees of cooling) that are easy to stop/reverse at any time. Further, there is much work to be done to solve difficult engineering challenges, such as how to build and operate a fleet of aircraft to efficiently lift and spray reflective particles at the small particle sizes needed.</p><p>Even as I have numerous conversations about AI business and governance here at the World Economic Forum, I am glad that AI climate modeling is helpful for addressing global warming.

For example, for math problems, they created rule-based systems that rewarded the model for returning the final answer in a particular format (an accuracy reward) and for showing its internal CoT steps within &lt;think&gt; tags (a format reward).</li><li>For further fine-tuning, they used the in-progress versions of R1 to generate around 600,000 responses to reasoning prompts, retaining only correct responses. They mixed in another 200,000 non-reasoning examples (such as language translation pairs) either generated by DeepSeek-V3-base or from its training dataset.</li><li>They fine-tuned the model using a final round of reinforcement learning.

But o1 and o3, its not-yet-widely-available successor, hide their reasoning steps. In contrast, DeepSeek-R1 bares all, allowing users to see the steps the model took to arrive at a particular answer. DeepSeek’s own experiments with distillation show how powerful such models can be as teachers to train smaller student models. Moreover, they appear to pass along some of the benefits of their reasoning skills, making their students more accurate.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;DeepSeek is rapidly emerging as a strong builder of open models. Not only are these models great performers, but their license permits use of their outputs for distillation, potentially pushing forward the state of the art for language models (and multimodal models) of all sizes.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/unnamed--45-.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"GIF of two humanoid robots walking, one on grass and the other on a paved surface.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/unnamed--45-.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"humanoid-robot-price-break\">Humanoid Robot Price Break</h1><p>Chinese robot makers Unitree and EngineAI showed off relatively low-priced humanoid robots that could bring advanced robotics closer to everyday applications.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;At the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Unitree showed its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VVMvtG9h8k2TW7Lw4hV5j_hZ5W1RGk9h5r6F7LN84393j3qgyTW6N1vHY6lZ3mrW3fX_Hm2llGSkW6_vxT_73CY2FW3-vGLw4QvgnrN5DJGb-xK9l9N455vmkZ5VbpW3k2FVL5MlDNrW7dLMN22ydRPgW17zwl5374K7qW7V2yHn3j9gtzV2SJKv5Q1_FmW7PHb_W8zp2D4W2RHgRb4vbNZPN8mj7T8NyzDCVGJHZg7C32DhW8kVR6y976d1rW5vjbN816__vwW7mXrs337zFCyW1t2LfX3rpXpmW4bf7GD7wHsP4W4pf_2d6j0JwCW8jCDsR18MnSGW9j2gqx7hFc1df8KT8KR04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">G1</a>&nbsp;($16,000 with three-finger hands, $21,000 with five-finger, articulated hands), which climbed stairs and navigated around obstacles.

For many industrial applications, wheeled robots — which are less expensive, more stable, and better able to carry heavy loads — will remain a sensible choice.

The bill would prohibit a short list of harmful or invasive uses of AI, such as output intended to manipulate users. It would impose strict oversight on AI systems that contribute to decisions in key areas like health care.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;Republican House Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced TRAIGA, also known as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/billtext/pdf/HB01709I.pdf?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9kgISsDFvuO8MZlBnFosRC4C4FiNqno6ahMESpHrnRkOKvDeon1AkJ43ZnkA-hwbA6vq6q#navpanes=0\" rel=\"noopener\">HB 1709</a>, to the state legislature at the end of 2024. If it’s passed and signed, the law would go into effect in September 2025.</p><ul><li>The proposed law would apply to any company that develops, distributes, or deploys an AI system while doing business in Texas, regardless of where the company is headquartered. It makes no distinction between large and small models or research and commercial uses. However, it includes a modest carve-out for independent small businesses that are based in the state.</li><li>The law controls “high-risk” AI systems that bear on consequential decisions in areas that include education, employment, financial services, transportation, housing, health care, and voting. The following uses of AI would be banned: manipulating, deceiving, or coercing users; inferring race or gender from biometric data; computing a “social score or similar categorical estimation or valuation of a person or group;” and generating sexually explicit deepfakes. The law is especially broad with respect to deepfakes: It outlaws any system that is “capable of producing unlawful visual material.”</li><li>Companies would have to notify users whenever AI is used. They would also have to safeguard against algorithmic discrimination, maintain and share detailed records of training data and accuracy metrics, assess impacts, and withdraw any system that violates the law until it can achieve compliance.</li><li>The Texas attorney general would investigate companies that build or use AI, file civil lawsuits, and impose penalties up to $200,000 per violation, with additional fines for ongoing noncompliance of $40,000 per day.</li><li>The bill would establish a Texas AI Council that reports to the governor, whose members would be appointed by the governor, lieutenant governor, and state legislative leaders. The council would monitor AI companies, develop non-binding ethical guidelines for them, and recommend new laws and regulations.</li></ul><p><strong>Sandbox:</strong>&nbsp;A “sandbox” provision would allow registered AI developers to test and refine AI systems temporarily with fewer restrictions. Developers who registered AI projects with the Texas AI Council would gain temporary immunity, even if their systems did not fully comply with the law. However, this exemption would come with conditions: Developers must submit detailed reports on their projects’ purposes, risks, and mitigation plans. The sandbox status would be in effect for 36 months (with possible extensions), and organizations would have to bring their systems into compliance or decommission them once the period ends. The Texas AI Council could revoke sandbox protections if it determined that a project posed a risk of public harm or failed to meet reporting obligations.</p><p><strong>Behind the news:</strong>&nbsp;Other U.S. states, too, are considering or have already passed laws that regulate AI:</p><ul><li>California&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/a-victory-for-innovation-and-open-source/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9kgISsDFvuO8MZlBnFosRC4C4FiNqno6ahMESpHrnRkOKvDeon1AkJ43ZnkA-hwbA6vq6q\" rel=\"noopener\">SB 1047</a>, aimed to regulate both open and closed models above a specific size.

New York’s proposed bill would focus on catastrophic harms potentially caused by AI models that require more than 10<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;FLOPs or cost $100 million or more to train). It would mandate third-party audits and protection for whistleblowers.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;AI is not specifically regulated at the national level in the United States. This leaves individual states free to formulate their own laws. However, state-by-state regulation risks a patchwork of laws in which a system — or a particular feature — may be legal in some states but not others. Moreover, given the distributed nature of AI development and deployment, a law that governs AI in an individual state could affect developers and users worldwide.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;The proposed bill has its positive aspects, particularly insofar as it seeks to restrict harmful applications rather than the underlying technology. However, it imposes burdensome requirements for compliance, suffers from overly broad language, fails to adequately protect open source, and doesn’t distinguish between research and commercial use. Beyond that, state-by-state regulation of AI is not workable. On the contrary, AI demands international conventions and standards.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/unnamed--48-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Workflow for inverse design using deep learning to predict S-parameters and radiation in structures.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/unnamed--48-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/unnamed--48-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/unnamed--48-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h1 id=\"generated-chip-designs-work-in-mysterious-ways\">Generated Chip Designs Work in Mysterious Ways</h1><p>Designing integrated circuits typically requires years of human expertise.
