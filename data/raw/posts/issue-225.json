Today, numerous open and closed source models are within easy reach. ChatGPT is the most popular way for consumers to chat with an LLM, but others abound, including Microsoft Bing, Google Bard, and offerings from startups such as Anthropic Claude, Inflection Pi, and perplexity.ai. There are also multiple options for developers, including APIs from Amazon Web Services, Azure, Cohere, Google Cloud, Hugging Face, OpenAI, and many others. The proliferation of options is &nbsp;exciting, and I hope it will continue!&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>For both consumer and developer use cases, open source models that you can host yourself, or even run locally on your laptop, are getting surprisingly good. For many applications, a good open source model can perform perhaps on par with the ChatGPT-3.5 of a year ago.

These days, I find myself using an LLM running on my laptop (which runs fairly quickly and guarantees privacy, since my data stays on my machine) about as often as a cloud-hosted one. I use a cloud-hosted model when I need a level of performance I can't get from a smaller, locally run, open source one.

For example, sometimes a model has refused to answer basic questions about an activity that harms the environment, even though I was just trying to understand that activity and had no intention of committing that harm. There are now open source alternatives that are less aggressively safety-tuned that I can use responsibly for particular applications.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>The wealth of alternatives is also a boon to developers. An emerging design pattern is to quickly build a prototype or initial product that delivers good performance by prompting an LLM, perhaps an expensive one like GPT-4. Later, if you need cheaper inference or better performance for a particular, narrowly scoped task, you can fine-tune one of the huge number of open source LLMs to your task. (Some developers reportedly are using data generated by GPT-4 for their own fine-tuning, although it’s not clear whether this violates its terms of use.)&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>In a year, we've gone from having essentially one viable option to having at least dozens.

PaLM-E takes a text command, and in executing the command, uses sensor data from a robot to resolve it into a series of low-level subcommands. A separate system converts these low-level commands into robotic control signals. The name adds E, for embodied, to that of Google’s large language model&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8iLoI0RWjjOhKe7WuJGFw_8hFeSmEdMIs-VNcc1gID3JxM9wd7-cZHvoC0u1A0izM0JsYL\" rel=\"noopener\">PaLM</a>.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;Large language models tend to perform well if they’re trained on a lot of data. We don’t have a lot of robotics data (that is, records of commands, actions taken, and corresponding sensor readings). We can supplement that with vision-language data, which is plentiful, to help the model learn relationships between words and what a robot sees, and ultimately transfer what it learns to performing robotics tasks.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;PaLM-E comprises a pretrained PaLM large language model and encoders that embed non-text inputs: (i) a pretrained vision transformer to embed images and (ii) a vanilla neural network to embed robot sensor data that described the pose, size, and color of objects in its view. In addition, the system relies on a motion controller that translates words into robotic control signals; in this case, a pretrained&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06817?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8iLoI0RWjjOhKe7WuJGFw_8hFeSmEdMIs-VNcc1gID3JxM9wd7-cZHvoC0u1A0izM0JsYL\" rel=\"noopener\">RT-1</a>. Given a high-level command (such as “I spilled my drink, can you bring me something to clean it up?”) — plus images or sensor data from the robot — PaLM-E evaluates the robot’s situation and generates lower-level instructions to be fed to the motion controller.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The authors trained the system for visual reasoning (fine-tuning the language model and ViT and training the vanilla neural network from scratch).

Given the interleaved input, the language model produced an answer (to a question-answering task), a caption (in an image captioning task), or instruction or sequence of instructions (for a robotics task).</li><li>They further trained the system using nearly 3,000 plans generated by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://say-can.github.io/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8iLoI0RWjjOhKe7WuJGFw_8hFeSmEdMIs-VNcc1gID3JxM9wd7-cZHvoC0u1A0izM0JsYL\" rel=\"noopener\">SayCan</a>, a system that translates high-level instructions into sequences of subtasks and robotic commands. Given a command, steps taken so far, and an image of the current scene, the language model generated the next step of a plan. For example, given the command to bring something to clean up a spilled drink, and the steps taken so far (“1. Find a sponge, 2. Pick up the sponge,”) plus an image embedding, the language model generated a response such as “3. Bring the sponge to the user.”</li><li>At inference, given a step in the plan, the RT-1 controller converted the words into robot control signals. The robot executed the task and generated a new image or sensor data. Given this output, the original instruction, and previous steps, the encoders produced embeddings and the language model generated the next step. It repeated this process until it generated the output “terminate.”</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The authors evaluated PaLM-E in a simulation where it executed tasks from TAMP, which accounted for 10 percent of its training/fine-tuning data. PaLM-E achieved 94.9 percent success. A version of PaLM-E trained only on TAMP achieved 48.6 percent. SayCan, which also was trained only on TAMP, achieved 36 percent. The authors also tested PaLM-E using two physical robots, qualitatively evaluating its response to commands such as “Bring me the rice chips from the drawer.” The robots were able to follow instructions even when people tried to thwart them (say, by returning the bag of chips to the drawer immediately after the robot had pulled them out).
