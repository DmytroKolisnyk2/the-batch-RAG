Many of the researchers who built them neglected to benchmark their work against established machine learning methods.</li><li>Many models designed to predict patient outcomes were trained only on data from patients who had died or recovered. These models didn’t learn from patients who remained symptomatic by the end of the study period, yielding prognoses that were either overly optimistic or overly dire.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> In a commentary that accompanied the survey, <em>BMJ</em>’s editors declared the models so “uniformly poor” that “none can be recommended for clinical use.”<br><br><strong>The path forward:</strong> The authors recommend that machine learning researchers adopt the 22-point <a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2088542/transparent-reporting-multivariable-prediction-model-individual-prognosis-diagnosis-tripod-explanation?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">TRIPOD</a> checklist as a standard for developing predictive medical AI. Developed by an international consortium of physicians and data scientists, the checklist is designed to help engineers report their work clearly and reduces risk of developing models with biased data.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Patients and health care systems alike need more accurate and faster diagnoses and prognoses. The AI community is used to publishing preliminary results to accelerate progress, but the health care community tends to wait for rigorous peer review to avoid causing harm.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Given how fast the Covid-19 situation is evolving, sharing results early and often is a good thing. But the AI community also needs new mechanisms to make sure preliminary models don’t cause harm.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Frequency20ASPECT.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Image processing technique explained\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"preserving-detail-in-image-inputs\">Preserving Detail in Image Inputs</h3><p>Given real-world constraints on memory and processing time, images are often downsampled before they’re fed into a neural network. But the process removes fine details, and that degrades accuracy. A new technique squeezes images with less compromise.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers at the Alibaba DAMO Academy and Arizona State University led by Kai Xu <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12416?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">reduce the memory needed for image processing</a> by using a technique inspired by JPEG image compression.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> JPEG removes information the human eye won’t miss by describing patterns of pixels as frequencies. Successive color changes from pixel to pixel are higher frequencies, while monochromatic stretches are lower frequencies. By cutting frequencies that have little visual effect, the algorithm compresses images with minimal impact on image quality. The researchers employed a similar strategy to reduce input data without losing information critical to learning.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers transformed images into the frequency domain, selected frequencies to remove, and fed the reduced frequency representation into ResNet-50 and MobileNet V2 models.</p><ul><li>The algorithm starts by converting RGB images to YCbCr format, which specifies brightness, red, and blue in each pixel. Humans are especially sensitive to brightness, making this format good for data reduction.</li><li>It transforms the YCbCr image into a frequency representation of the same size. Then it groups similar frequencies into channels (which longer capture brightness and color). The grouping increases the number of channels by a fixed amount but reduces height and width of the images to a neural network-friendly size.</li><li>The researchers propose two methods to decide which frequencies to discard. In one, a separate model learns to turn each channel on or off based on how it affects classification performance. In the other, they use rules based on observation; for example, lower frequency channels tend to capture more useful information.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> ResNet-50 trained on <a href=\"http://www.image-net.org/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">ImageNet</a> in the usual way achieves 76 percent top-1 accuracy, but slimming the input in the frequency domain increased accuracy by 1.38 percent. A MobileNet V2 trained on ImageNet and ResNet-50 feature pyramid network trained on <a href=\"http://cocodataset.org/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">COCO</a> saw similar improvements.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Many images are much larger than the input size of most convolutional neural networks, which makes downsampling a necessary evil. Rescaling the frequency representation of images preserves relevant information, so downsampling doesn’t need to hurt performance.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Smartphones capture images in 4K, but CNNs require 224×224 pixels. It’s nice to know the missing resolution isn’t going entirely to waste.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corn20Revised.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Information related to a convolutional neural network that predicts corn yields in fields\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"ai-on-the-cob\">AI on the Cob</h3><p>Deep learning research is harvesting better ways to manage farms.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> A convolutional neural network <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169919308543?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">predicted</a> corn yields in fields across the U.S. Midwest.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign built a network that forecasts the quantity of corn that will grow seasonally in a given field under variable rates of seeding and nitrogen fertilization.</p><ul><li>The researchers chose nine experimental fields in Illinois, Ohio, Nebraska, and Kansas, with an average size of nearly 100 acres.</li><li>Their best-performing model subdivided each field into plots 5 meters square. For each square, the researchers entered various levels of seed and fertilizer along with elevation, soil quality, and satellite imagery.</li><li>The five inputs were fed into separate convolutional layers as raster images representing parameters of each square. These layers had access to only one parameter each and were not combined until the final fully connected layers.</li><li>Keeping the inputs in separate layers until late in the network helped the architecture process spatial data that varied significantly over space; for instance, soil quality or elevation that differed from one square to the next.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The team’s model averaged .70 root mean squared error of the mean yield standard deviation in all fields. It predicted yields more accurately than other neural networks the team built in all but one. It was also better than a set of non-neural benchmarks, outperforming a random forest model by 29 percent and a multiple linear regression model by 68 percent.<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong> Agriculture requires farmers to manage numerous environmental factors and decision points, from weather patterns to hiring manual labor. Machine learning can help at every stage. Big-ag heavyweights like John Deere as well as startups like Dot and SwarmFarm offer highly automated tractors including machines that use advanced image recognition to kill individual weeds. Landing AI helped design a rig that automatically optimizes harvesting. (Disclosure: Andrew Ng is CEO of Landing AI.)

The authors are performing more trials to improve the model and working on an optimization algorithm so farmers can generate fertilizer and seed maps for their own fields.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> In many developing economies, younger people don’t want to make their living from farming, and small family-run farms are being consolidated into larger plots. This creates opportunities for AI and automation to make agriculture more efficient, and potentially to make food more affordable and protect the environment.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AI4MC2BatchAd.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>How can you estimate a patient’s future health?

It identifies individual users by scanning where the sun doesn’t shine.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The system, developed by a team led by Stanford radiologist and bioengineer Seung-min Park, analyzes excreta in three ways:</p><ul><li>Urinalysis: When an infrared sensor detects a stream, a urinalysis testing strip extends into the line of fire.

Urine flow: A computer vision model measures the rate and volume of micturition by analyzing imagery from two high-speed cameras mounted below the bowl.</li><li>Stool quality: When a user sits down, a sensor activates an LED light to illuminate the inside of the bowl and tells a drain-facing camera to begin recording. When the user has finished, the camera sends the video to a cloud server, where a convolutional neural network sorts frames depicting stool. A second CNN categorizes the feces into one of the seven categories of the <a href=\"https://www.continence.org.au/pages/bristol-stool-chart.html?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Bristol Stool Form Scale</a>.

Its inventors hope to make it into a commercial product, which would require software upgrades as well as self-cleaning mechanisms for the sensors.

New research offers a way to avoid so-called double descent.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Double descent occurs when a model’s performance changes in unpredictable ways as the amount of training data or number of parameters crosses a certain threshold. The error falls as expected with additional data or parameters, but then rises, drops again, and may take further turns. Preetum Nakkiran and collaborators at Harvard, Stanford, and Microsoft found a way to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01897.pdf?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">eliminate double descent</a> in some circumstances.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> The researchers evaluated double descent in terms of a model’s test error. Framing the problem this way led them to the conclusion that regularization — discouraging a model from having large weights — can prevent it. Where <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08560?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">previous research</a> described the occurrence of double descent as models or datasets grow infinitely large, the authors’ analysis applies to all sizes. This enables them to offer a practical approach to managing the problem.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> The researchers proved that double descent is manageable in linear regression models if the dataset meets certain criteria. They also demonstrated experimental results for a broader class of problems.</p><ul><li>A model’s test error is its average mean squared error over all possible test sets. If the error increases with the size of the model or training set, the model can suffer from double descent.</li><li>The researchers analyzed linear regression models with L1 regularization, also called ridge regression. Selecting the right penalty for a particular model or dataset size mitigates double descent if the input is Gaussian with zero mean and covariance matrix given by the identity matrix.</li><li>In models that don’t use linear regression, such as simple convolutional neural networks, some regularization penalty values mitigated double descent. However, the researchers couldn’t find a way, other than trial and error while peeking at the test set, to choose the penalty.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The researchers proved that their regularization technique prevents double descent in linear regression models if the dataset meets certain criteria. They also used linear regression models with datasets that didn’t match all of their criteria, and in every case they considered, they found a regularization penalty that did the trick. <br><br><strong>Yes, but:</strong> Although the technique avoided double descent in a variety of circumstances, particularly in linear regression models, the authors were not able to prove that their technique works in every case.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This approach to mitigating double descent may look limited, since it applies only to some linear regression models. But improvements could have broad impact, given that linear regression is ubiquitous in neural network output layers.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Double descent is sneaky. Researchers can miss it when they run benchmark datasets if they cherry-pick the best-performing models. And engineers can fail to detect it in applications because it isn’t predictable from results on the training set. It may be rare in practice, but we’d rather not have to worry about it.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Construc1-Smartividio.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Smartvid.io tool recognizing when workers get too close to each other\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"workers-of-the-world-don%E2%80%99t-unite\">Workers of the World, Don’t Unite</h3><p>Computer vision is helping construction workers keep their social distance.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Smartvid.io, a service that focuses on construction sites, offers a tool that <a href=\"https://www.smartvid.io/ai-in-construction-blog/vinnie-learns-construction-phases-work-at-height-workers-in-groups?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">recognizes</a> when workers get too close to each other.
