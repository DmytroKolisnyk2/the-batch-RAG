They evolved increasingly clever strategies, eventually hacking the game world’s physics to gain advantage.</p><p><strong>What happened</strong>: The researchers trained the agents to navigate and manipulate their environment and juiced them with reinforcement learning. Then they divided their creations into teams of hiders and seekers and set them loose in a virtual world that included movable blocks, walls, and ramps. <br><br><strong>How it works</strong>: Seekers scored points if they caught sight of a hider. Hiders scored if they finished a game without being seen. An agent could move or lock objects in place; but only the agent that locked a given object could unlock it again.</p><ul><li>The agents figured out the basics over the first several million rounds. Around game 22 million, hiders — which were given a grace period at the start of each round to scramble for cover — began building shelters out of the movable objects.</li><li>Roughly 100 million rounds in, seekers learned to infiltrate these hideaways using ramps. A few million later, the hiders stymied this strategy by locking the ramps.</li><li>The researchers say they didn’t expect the agents to learn much more. But around game 450 million, seekers discovered they could push blocks around even if they were standing on top. This allowed them to surf to hiders’ walls and walk right into their hideaways (as seen in the animation above).</li><li>Hiders eventually discovered the final, unbeatable strategy: Lock up every moveable object they wouldn’t be using as a barricade, then lock themselves inside a shelter of movable walls.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: Hide-and-seek strategies could map to many real-world applications. For instance, rescue robots could be programmed as seekers — with rules restricting which types of objects are okay to pick up or move — to sift through rubble for survivors after a disaster.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking</strong>: Reinforcement learning continues to find clever solutions. But the need to play 480 million rounds limits such techniques to simulated environments. We look forward to breakthroughs in small-data RL that make it possible to apply such techniques to physical robots that can play, say, thousands of games before they wear out. <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/reptile/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">Meta learning</a>, which organizations including OpenAI have worked on, could be an important step in this direction.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ANNOTATOR.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\" Proportion of examples covered by number of annotators (sorted by number of annotations)\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"ai-knows-who-labeled-the-data\">AI Knows Who Labeled the Data<br></h2><p>The latest language models are great at answering questions about a given text passage. However, these models are also powerful enough to recognize an individual writer’s style, which can clue them in to the right answers. New <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07898?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">research</a> measures such annotator bias in several data sets.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> Researchers from Tel Aviv and Bar-Ilan Universities uncovered annotator bias in several crowdsourced data sets.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Only a few dozen people may generate the lion’s share of examples in a crowdsourced natural-language data set (see graph above). Having an overly small team of annotators introduces bias that can influence a model’s behavior.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Mor Geva, Yoav Goldberg, and Jonathan Berant studied three data sets: MNLI, OpenBookQA, and CommonsenseQA. They fine-tuned the BERT architecture for each of three experiments:</p><ul><li>The authors measured the change in BERT’s performance after giving input sentences an annotator label. This experiment probed the degree to which the annotator’s identity encoded the correct answer.</li><li>Then they used BERT to predict the annotator of individual text samples. This tested whether the annotator’s style encoded the person’s identity.</li><li>Finally, they observed the difference in performance when the test and training sets had no annotators in common versus when the training set included samples from test-set annotators. An increase in performance further confirmed the presence of annotator bias.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Performance improved an average of 4 percent across the three data sets when input text included an annotator label. The model inferred annotators most accurately in data sets created by fewer contributors. In two of three data sets, mixing in samples from test-set annotators during training improved test accuracy, implying that the model doesn’t generalize to novel annotators.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Annotator bias is pernicious and difficult to detect. This work raises a red flag around the number of contributors to data sets used in natural-language research.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Benchmark data sets are used to identify the best-performing models, which drives further research. If the data is biased, it may lead that research astray. Here’s hoping this work inspires further enquiry into sources of bias and ways to assess and mitigate it.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ezgif.com-resize201.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Drone used for surveying on construction site\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"robots-put-down-stakes\">Robots Put Down Stakes</h2><p>Construction projects require teams of surveyors who continually map blueprints to precise, real-world locations. Drones might do it faster, saving time and money.<br><br><strong>What’s new</strong>: Civdrone, a startup with offices in New York and Tel Aviv, is developing a <a href=\"https://www.therobotreport.com/civdrone-disrupt-construction-workflows/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">platform</a> that uses drones to place surveying stakes around construction sites.<br><br><strong>How it works</strong>:</p><ul><li>The company uses off-the-shelf drones, each piloted by a human operator and equipped with a quiver of stakes.</li><li>Where a survey marker is needed, a drone flies to the location, lands, and stabs a stake into the ground using a small pile driver.</li><li>Each stake is topped with a QR code, which the drone encodes with the location’s GPS coordinates and elevation. The QR code can also contain information such as the presence of a gas pipe buried below.</li><li>Construction workers can use a phone or dedicated QR-code reader to read the information.</li></ul><p><strong>Behind the news: </strong>Construction is a hot area for drones, where mostly they provide a bird’s-eye view of job sites to help builders plan, track progress, and spot hazards. One maker of software for commercial and industrial drones <a href=\"https://www.dronedeploy.com/blog/rise-drones-construction-XNpCThIAACcA9X7G/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">says</a> the construction industry is its fastest-growing customer. <br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Surveying ensures that buildings stay true to their designs and plumb even as the ground shifts from day to day. Highly trained surveyors can insert around a hundred markers per day. Civdrone says it can do the work four times faster.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> Construction companies live and die by their ability to stay on schedule and budget. Eliminating even the smallest delays — such as workers waiting for surveyors to finish their work — can keep projects on track and maintain wiggle room for when bigger snafus inevitably occur.</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">DEEPLEARNING.AI</a></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen20Shot202019-08-2620at203.20.4220PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Is your neural network too deep?

Now that they can orate entire books, we need new benchmarks.<br><br><strong>What’s new:</strong> A Google research team <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03965?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\" noopener\">discovered</a> that the usual measure of text-to-speech quality — having human judges rate single-sentence examples for human-like realism — varies widely depending on how samples are presented. That makes the standard procedure insufficient to evaluate performance on longer texts.<br><br><strong>Key insight:</strong> Rob Clark and colleagues tested samples of various lengths and formats to see how they affected quality ratings.<br><br><strong>How it works:</strong> Judges rated human and synthesized voices reading identical news articles and conversational transcripts.</p><ul><li>The judges evaluated samples in three forms: paragraphs, isolated sentences making up those paragraphs, and sentences preceded by the prior sentence or two (which were not rated).</li><li>For sentences accompanied by preceding material, the preceding material was presented in human, synthesized, or text versions.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Samples that included prior sentences earned higher scores than sentences in isolation, regardless of whether they were spoken by humans or machines. That is, the additional context made the synthesized voices seem more realistic. Moreover, readings of paragraphs scored higher than readings of their component sentences, showing that isolated sentences aren’t a good gauge of long-form text-to-speech.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Metrics that reflect AI’s performance relative to human capabilities are essential to progress. The authors show that the usual measure of text-to-speech performance doesn’t reflect performance with respect to longer texts. They conclude that several measures are necessary.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> As natural language processing evolves to encompass longer forms, researchers are setting their sights on problems that are meaningful in that context.
