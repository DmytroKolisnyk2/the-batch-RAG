I’ll share lessons I’ve learned about this here and in future letters.</em><br><br><em>A key concept in building AI products is iteration. As I’ve explained in <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/iteration-in-ai-development/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">past</a> <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/data-centric-ai-development-part-3-limit-data-collection-time/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">letters</a>, developing a machine learning system is a highly iterative process. First you build something, then run experiments to see how it performs, then analyze the results, which enables you to build a better version based on what you’ve learned. You may go through this loop several times in various phases of development — collecting data, training a model, deploying the system — before you have a finished product.</em><br><br><em>Why is development of machine learning systems so iterative? Because (i) when starting on a project, you almost never know what strange and wonderful things you’ll find in the data, and discoveries along the way will help you to make better decisions on how to improve the model; and (ii) it’s relatively quick and inexpensive to try out different models.</em></p><p><em>Not all projects are iterative. For example, if you’re preparing a medical drug for approval by the U.S. government — an expensive process that can cost tens of millions of dollars and take years — you’d usually want to get the drug formulation and experimental design right the first time, since repeating the process to correct a mistake would be costly in time and money. Or if you’re building a space telescope (such as the wonderful <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images/gallery?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_TYKhuzGUlx4OZtJCltNp_bdr7sT9KULumb_ZUyX__oLKmDhHFRh6msnan2gwLu0_jUKB5\" rel=\"noopener\">Webb Space Telescope</a>) that’s intended to operate far from Earth with little hope of repair if something goes wrong, you’d think through every detail carefully before you hit the launch button on your rocket.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-05-at-10.58.31-AM-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Iteration process chart\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-05-at-10.58.31-AM-1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-05-at-10.58.31-AM-1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-05-at-10.58.31-AM-1.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>Iterating on projects tends to be beneficial when (i) you face uncertainty or risk, and building or launching something can provide valuable feedback that helps you reduce the uncertainty or risk, and (ii) the cost of each attempt is modest.</em></p><p><em>This is why </em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_TYKhuzGUlx4OZtJCltNp_bdr7sT9KULumb_ZUyX__oLKmDhHFRh6msnan2gwLu0_jUKB5\" rel=\"noopener\">The Lean Startup</a><em>, a book that has significantly influenced my thinking, advocates building a minimum viable product (MVP) and launching it quickly. Developing software products often involves uncertainty about how users will react, which creates risk for the success of the product. Making a quick-and-dirty, low-cost implementation helps you to get valuable user feedback before you’ve invested too much in building features that users don’t want. An MVP lets you resolve questions about what users want quickly and inexpensively, so you can make decisions and investments with greater confidence.</em></p><p><em>When building AI products, I often see two major sources of uncertainty, which in turn creates risk:</em></p><ul><li><em><strong>Users.</strong> The considerations here are similar to those that apply to building software products.

A model can learn relationships between words and pictures via pretraining on text-image pairs. Then it can be adapted for video by adding further layers that process image patches across frames and — while keeping the pretrained layers fixed — fine-tuning the new layers on videos, which are plentiful. In this way, a system can generate videos using knowledge it learned from text-image pairs.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The authors pretrained a series of models (one transformer and four <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_TYKhuzGUlx4OZtJCltNp_bdr7sT9KULumb_ZUyX__oLKmDhHFRh6msnan2gwLu0_jUKB5\" rel=\"noopener\">U-Net</a> diffusion models) to generate images from text, generate in-between video frames, and boost image resolution. To pretrain the text-to-image models, they used <a href=\"https://openreview.net/pdf?id=M3Y74vmsMcY&utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_TYKhuzGUlx4OZtJCltNp_bdr7sT9KULumb_ZUyX__oLKmDhHFRh6msnan2gwLu0_jUKB5\" rel=\"noopener\">2.3 billion text-image pairs</a>. After pretraining, they modified some of the models to process sequences of video frames: On top of each pretrained convolutional layer, the authors stacked a 1D convolutional layer that processed a grid of pixels in each frame; and on top of each pretrained attention layer, they stacked a 1D attention layer that, likewise, processed a grid of pixels in each frame. To fine-tune or train the modified models on video, they used 20 million <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00650?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_TYKhuzGUlx4OZtJCltNp_bdr7sT9KULumb_ZUyX__oLKmDhHFRh6msnan2gwLu0_jUKB5\" rel=\"noopener\">internet</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10337?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_TYKhuzGUlx4OZtJCltNp_bdr7sT9KULumb_ZUyX__oLKmDhHFRh6msnan2gwLu0_jUKB5\" rel=\"noopener\">videos</a>.</p><ul><li>Given a piece of text, the pretrained transformer converted it into an embedding.</li><li>The authors pretrained a diffusion model to take the embeddings and generate a 64x64 image. Then they modified the model as described above and fine-tuned it to generate sequences of 16 frames of 64x64 resolution.</li><li>They added a second diffusion model. Given a 76-frame video made up of 16 frames, each followed by four masked (blacked-out) frames, it learned to regenerate the masked frames.</li><li>They added a third diffusion model and pretrained it, given a 64x64 image, to increase the image’s resolution to 256x256. After modifying the model, they fine-tuned it to increase the resolution 76 successive frames to 256x256.</li><li>Given a 256x256 image, a fourth diffusion model learned to increase its resolution to 768x768. Due to memory restrictions, this model was not modified for video or further trained on videos. At inference, given the 76-frame video, it increased the resolution of each frame without reference to other frames.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> The authors compared their system’s output to that of the previous state of the art, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15868?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_TYKhuzGUlx4OZtJCltNp_bdr7sT9KULumb_ZUyX__oLKmDhHFRh6msnan2gwLu0_jUKB5\" rel=\"noopener\">CogVideo</a>, which takes a similar approach but requires training on text-video pairs.

Given rising interest rates, inflation, and the threat of recession, that explains the falloff in funding for startups without proven market value. Companies that focus on proven applications and markets should continue to prosper, although competition is bound to stiffen as vendors are pressed to demonstrate that their offering is superior.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> As we noted in <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/what-rising-interest-rates-mean-for-ai-part-1-whats-likely-to-happen/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">previous</a> <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/what-rising-interest-rates-mean-for-ai-part-2-why-it-still-makes-sense-to-forge-ahead/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\">issues</a> of <em>The Batch</em>, rising interest rates and falling stock indices signal that AI developers should be ready for increased pressure to develop projects that demonstrate near-term, tangible value.

Water on the Moon could provide clues about the heavenly body’s origin as well as hydration, radiation shielding, and propellant for missions further out in the solar system.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong> This AI project is out of this world!</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/10/DIALOG.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Illustration of the Dialogue Transformer Language Model (DLM)\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/10/DIALOG.gif 600w\"></figure><h1 id=\"the-sound-of-conversation\">The Sound of Conversation</h1><p>In spoken conversation, people naturally take turns amid interjections, overlaps, and other patterns that aren’t strictly verbal. A new approach generated natural-sounding — though not necessarily semantically coherent — audio dialogs without training on text transcriptions that mark when one party should stop speaking and the other should chime in.</p><p><strong>What's new:</strong> Tu Anh Nguyen and colleagues at Meta, France’s National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology, and École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales introduced <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16502?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_TYKhuzGUlx4OZtJCltNp_bdr7sT9KULumb_ZUyX__oLKmDhHFRh6msnan2gwLu0_jUKB5\" rel=\"noopener\">Dialogue Transformer Language Model</a> (DLM), a system that learned to incorporate the interruptions, pauses, and inflections of conversational speech into audio dialogues. You can listen to examples <a href=\"https://speechbot.github.io/dgslm/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_TYKhuzGUlx4OZtJCltNp_bdr7sT9KULumb_ZUyX__oLKmDhHFRh6msnan2gwLu0_jUKB5\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Prior efforts to model dialogue were based on text, but text datasets omit information that’s unique to spoken interactions. Training directly on recordings of spoken dialogue can enable models to learn this additional mode of expression so they can mimic face-to-face conversation more naturally.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong> The system encoded two audio signals — two sides of a spoken conversation — into tokens. It processed each token stream through a separate transformer and decoded the tokens back to audio signals. The transformers were trained on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.35111/w4bk-9b14?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_TYKhuzGUlx4OZtJCltNp_bdr7sT9KULumb_ZUyX__oLKmDhHFRh6msnan2gwLu0_jUKB5\" rel=\"noopener\">Fisher English Training Speech</a>, a dataset that comprises over 10,000 telephone conversations, an average of 10 minutes long, recorded using a separate audio channel for each participant.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07447?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_TYKhuzGUlx4OZtJCltNp_bdr7sT9KULumb_ZUyX__oLKmDhHFRh6msnan2gwLu0_jUKB5\" rel=\"noopener\">HuBERT</a>, a self-supervised system that produces speech representations, tokenized the audio signals using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and transformer, which reduced 16,000 samples per second to 50. To adapt it to the Fisher dataset, the authors trained it to generate masked tokens.</li><li>Given tokens from HuBERT, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05646?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_TYKhuzGUlx4OZtJCltNp_bdr7sT9KULumb_ZUyX__oLKmDhHFRh6msnan2gwLu0_jUKB5\" rel=\"noopener\">HiFi-GAN</a>, a generative adversarial network with CNN architecture, learned to generate the audio waveform of one speaker.</li><li>Given the token streams, two transformers with shared weights learned to predict new tokens. The authors modified the transformers by adding, between the usual self-attention and fully connected layers, a cross-attention layer that attended to tokens from both signals. Estimating each token’s duration meant the authors could remove repetitions of the same token from the training data to avoid generating overly elongated sounds (such as a “hmm” that never ends).</li><li>At inference, the transformers repeatedly added the next predicted tokens to two sequences, each of which started with a preset starting token. HiFi-GAN converted the sequence into audio.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong> Crowdsourced evaluators compared DLM to a similar approach that used a single transformer to process both channels of conversation. They rated naturalness of turn-taking and meaningfulness on a 1 to 5 scale. (Ground-truth dialogs scored around 4.25 for both criteria.) DLM performed relatively well in turn-taking though poorly in meaningful output. For turn-taking, DLM achieved 3.86 while the single transformer achieved 3.46. For meaningfulness, DLM achieved 2.71, while the single transformer achieved 2.46.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Two transformers can model a pair of participants in conversation (or other interaction) more effectively than one. Connecting them via cross attention layers enables them to be aware of one another’s activity without needing to predict it. This simplifies the task of modeling their interactions while avoiding potentially confounding variables such as who said what.</p><p><strong>We're thinking:</strong> The system’s ability to mimic the ebb and flow of conversation is impressive, but its verbal output is largely gibberish. To be fair, training on only 1,700 hours of audio conversation may not be expected to impart much about semantics. We look forward to an update that produces more cogent spoken conversation.</p>","comment_id":"633dd705bd09e0003d62fc0d","feature_image":"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-05-at-10.58.31-AM.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2022-10-05T12:12:05.000-07:00","updated_at":"2023-02-06T13:11:42.000-08:00","published_at":"2022-10-05T12:47:53.000-07:00","custom_excerpt":"The Batch - AI News & Insights.
