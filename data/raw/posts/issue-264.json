GPT-4 cost $36 per million tokens at its initial release in March 2023.&nbsp;This price reduction over 17 months corresponds to about a 79% drop in price per year: 4/36 = (1 - p)<sup>17/12</sup>. (OpenAI charges a lower price, just $2 per million tokens, for using a new Batch API that takes up to 24 hours to respond to a batch of prompts. That’s an 87% drop in price per year.)</p><p>As you can see, token prices are falling rapidly! One force that’s driving prices down is the release of open weights models such as Llama 3.1. If API providers, including startups Anyscale, Fireworks, Together.ai, and some large cloud companies, do not have to worry about recouping the cost of developing a model, they can compete directly on price and a few other factors such as speed.</p><p>Further, hardware innovations by companies such as Groq (a leading player in fast token generation), Samba Nova (which serves Llama 3.1 405B tokens at an impressive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sambanova.ai/blog/speed-record-on-llama-3.1-405b?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_m9bbH_7ECE1h3lZ3D61TYg52rKpifVNjL4fvJ85uqggrXsWDBTB7YooFLJeNXHWqhvOyC\" rel=\"noopener\">114 tokens per second</a>), and wafer-scale computation startup Cerebras (which just announced a new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://siliconangle.com/2024/08/27/cerebras-systems-throws-down-gauntlet-to-nvidia-launch-of-worlds-fastest-ai-inference-service/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_m9bbH_7ECE1h3lZ3D61TYg52rKpifVNjL4fvJ85uqggrXsWDBTB7YooFLJeNXHWqhvOyC\" rel=\"noopener\">offering</a>), as well as the semiconductor giants NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, will drive further price cuts.</p><p>When building applications, I find it useful to design to where the technology is going rather than only where it has been.

Further, even agentic workloads are already quite affordable for many applications. Let's say you build an application to assist a human worker, and it uses 100 tokens per second continuously: At $4/million tokens, you'd be spending only $1.44/hour – which is significantly lower than the minimum wage in the U.S. and many other countries.&nbsp;</p><p>So how can AI companies prepare?</p><ul><li>First, I continue to hear from teams that are surprised to find out how cheap LLM usage is when they actually work through cost calculations. For many applications, it isn’t worth too much effort to optimize the cost. So first and foremost, I advise teams to focus on building a useful application rather than on optimizing LLM costs.</li><li>Second, even if an application is marginally too expensive to run today, it may be worth deploying in anticipation of lower prices.&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, as new models get released, it might be worthwhile to periodically examine an application to decide whether to switch to a new model either from the same provider (such as switching from GPT-4 to the latest GPT-4o-2024-08-06) or a different provider, to take advantage of falling prices and/or increased capabilities.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Because multiple providers now host Llama 3.1 and other open-weight models, if you use one of these models, it might be possible to switch between providers without too much testing (though implementation details — specifically quantization, does mean that different offerings of the model do differ in performance).&nbsp;When switching between models, unfortunately, a major barrier is still the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/we-need-better-evals-for-llm-applications/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_m9bbH_7ECE1h3lZ3D61TYg52rKpifVNjL4fvJ85uqggrXsWDBTB7YooFLJeNXHWqhvOyC\" rel=\"noopener\">difficulty of implementing evals</a>, so carrying out regression testing to make sure your application will still perform after you swap in a new model can be challenging.

For instance, they reveal only that an organization aimed to influence AI policy, not the directions in which they aimed to influence it. Similarly, the disclosures shed no light on other efforts to influence laws and regulations such as advertising or campaign contributions. They also don’t reveal how much an organization discussed AI relative to other topics and concerns. For instance, last year the American Medical Association spent $21.2 million on lobbying including AI but, given the wide range of policy issues involved in medicine, AI likely accounted for a small amount of the total.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Behind the news:</strong>&nbsp;The ramp-up in AI lobbying comes as the U.S. Congress is considering a growing number of laws that would regulate the technology. Since 2023, more than 115 bills have been proposed that seek to restrict AI systems, require developers to disclose or evaluate them, or protect consumers against potential harms like AI bias, infringement of privacy or other rights, or spreading inaccurate information&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/artificial-intelligence-legislation-tracker?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_m9bbH_7ECE1h3lZ3D61TYg52rKpifVNjL4fvJ85uqggrXsWDBTB7YooFLJeNXHWqhvOyC\" rel=\"noopener\">according to</a>&nbsp;the nonprofit, nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice.

Moreover, the U.S. will hold national elections in November, and lobbying of all kinds typically intensifies as organizations seek to influence candidates for office.<br><br><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Given the large amount of AI development that takes place in the U.S., laws that govern AI in this country have an outsized influence over AI development worldwide. So it’s helpful to know which companies and institutions seek to influence those laws and in what directions. That the army of AI lobbyists includes companies large and small as well as far-flung institutions, with varying degrees of direct involvement in building or using AI, reflects both the technology’s power and the importance of this moment in charting its path forward.<br><br><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;We favor thoughtful regulation of AI applications that reinforces their tremendous potential to do good and limits potential harms that may result from flaws like bias or privacy violations. However, it’s critical to regulate applications, which put technology to specific uses, not the underlying technology, whose valuable uses are wide-ranging and subject to human creativity. It’s also critical to encourage, and not stifle, open models that multiply the potential good that AI can do. We hope the AI community can come together on these issues.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/08/unnamed--3-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"674\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/unnamed--3-.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/unnamed--3-.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2024/08/unnamed--3-.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">A graphic shows an any-to-any multimodal model, with text mapping to RGB or geometric modalities.</span></figcaption></figure><h1 id=\"multimodal-to-the-max\">Multimodal to the Max</h1><p>Researchers introduced a model that handles an unprecedented number of input and output types, including many related to performing computer vision tasks.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;Roman Bachmann, Oguzhan Fatih Kar, David Mizrahi and colleagues at EPFL and Apple built&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09406?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_m9bbH_7ECE1h3lZ3D61TYg52rKpifVNjL4fvJ85uqggrXsWDBTB7YooFLJeNXHWqhvOyC\" rel=\"noopener\">4M-21</a>, a system that works with 21 input and output types.
