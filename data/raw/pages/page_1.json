          "html": "<p>Dear friends,</p><p>The buzz over DeepSeek this week crystallized, for many people, a few important trends that have been happening in plain sight: (i) China is catching up to the U.S. in generative AI, with implications for the AI supply chain. (ii) Open weight models are commoditizing the foundation-model layer, which creates opportunities for application builders. (iii) Scaling up isn’t the only path to AI progress. Despite the massive focus on and hype around processing power, algorithmic innovations are rapidly pushing down training costs.</p><p>About a week ago, DeepSeek, a company based in China, released&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/deepseek-r1-an-affordable-rival-to-openais-o1/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9blkmNCmkSgQZlF3w69mEVR39Kcgh5igqFqSYQXxJbJImIrQOL0IJdK2usUU4q7nNePZXv\" rel=\"noopener\">DeepSeek-R1</a>, a remarkable model whose performance on benchmarks is comparable to OpenAI’s o1. Further, it was released as an open weight model with a permissive MIT license. At Davos last week, I got a lot of questions about it from non-technical business leaders. And on Monday, the stock market saw a “DeepSeek selloff”: The share prices of Nvidia and a number of other U.S. tech companies plunged. (As of the time of writing, they have recovered somewhat.)</p><p>Here’s what I think DeepSeek has caused many people to realize:</p><p><strong>China is catching up to the U.S. in generative AI.&nbsp;</strong>When ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, the U.S. was significantly ahead of China in generative AI. Impressions change slowly, and so even recently I heard friends in both the U.S. and China say they thought China was behind. But in reality, this gap has rapidly eroded over the past two years. With models from China such as Qwen (which my teams have used for months), Kimi, InternVL, and DeepSeek, China had clearly been closing the gap, and in areas such as video generation there were already moments where China seemed to be in the lead.</p><p>I’m thrilled that DeepSeek-R1 was released as an open weight model, with a technical report that shares many details. In contrast, a number of U.S. companies have pushed for regulation to stifle open source by hyping up hypothetical AI dangers such as human extinction. It is now clear that open source/open weight models are a key part of the AI supply chain: Many companies will use them. If the U.S. continues to stymie open source, China will come to dominate this part of the supply chain and many businesses will end up using models that reflect China’s values much more than America’s.</p><p><strong>Open weight models are commoditizing the foundation-model layer.</strong>&nbsp;As I wrote previously, LLM token prices have been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/falling-llm-token-prices-and-what-they-mean-for-ai-companies/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9blkmNCmkSgQZlF3w69mEVR39Kcgh5igqFqSYQXxJbJImIrQOL0IJdK2usUU4q7nNePZXv\" rel=\"noopener\">falling</a>&nbsp;rapidly, and open weights have contributed to this trend and given developers more choice. OpenAI’s o1 costs $60 per million output tokens; DeepSeek R1 costs $2.19. This nearly 30x difference brought the trend of falling prices to the attention of many people.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/Captura-de-pantalla-2025-01-29-a-la-s--1.31.32-p.-m..png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Blue whale logo biting and breaking a computer chip, with debris flying.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1196\" height=\"696\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/Captura-de-pantalla-2025-01-29-a-la-s--1.31.32-p.-m..png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/Captura-de-pantalla-2025-01-29-a-la-s--1.31.32-p.-m..png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/Captura-de-pantalla-2025-01-29-a-la-s--1.31.32-p.-m..png 1196w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>The business of training foundation models and selling API access is tough. Many companies in this area are still looking for a path to recouping the massive cost of model training. The article “<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VXh_Qm5KbXxcW4Xwy2w54Qvn8VDyhz95rpBjMN4Rsyg63qgyTW7lCdLW6lZ3nZW58Md6V8n62H8W1Xy7Fh7pDgmlW1_d1pS1HpN5KW2-f95T7Rjym-W8S4_zx4WvtXtW2XS44J5Nsr8HN9bYgNW38zBwW5wbm7G606tD0W34g-sL6HQwV7W2-g3434hlydmW28tdH11M6mVxW5Ss5jQ8vDPBkW61_Y6G3nghy2W6gVxxZ4xgJBxW7sP2vV5zfKw5VgZ_6t5XSx-WW3t838B8JlmQpW5Gcpdw5dBRMbN1H1DSzQcC-HN8SwbVGt26JDW8cgWNr5H9SDCW1R4lyR3q6Pv_W7k22V37K_XMQW4t5-FQ6_nvljf7Z3qb-04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">AI’s $600B Question</a>” lays out the challenge well (but, to be clear, I think the foundation model companies are doing great work, and I hope they succeed). In contrast, building applications on top of foundation models presents many great business opportunities. Now that others have spent billions training such models, you can access these models for mere dollars to build customer service chatbots, email summarizers, AI doctors, legal document assistants, and much more.</p><p><strong>Scaling up isn’t the only path to AI progress.</strong>&nbsp;There’s been a lot of hype around scaling up models as a way to drive progress. To be fair, I was an early&nbsp;<a href=\"https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VXh_Qm5KbXxcW4Xwy2w54Qvn8VDyhz95rpBjMN4RsygK3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3plN2fbywD3qy7zVWxjrC2BXSstW5mSjrR476trZW2m1GyH23Vm4bW2GxwrR6kkZx_W8VCPP46phNgbW5MwvKB4pVDQqW5T_CsY18p01jW4Gj9WK5GVM2MW8Yzn8-1yfDFlV22wSP48x9vqW45SYRw3k2487N3WlTRsScYD9W1_4y-m4JDzBLW2lhvpX2xglBVW7vR8bP2hqPsYW2vc-2s2jxYTwW8Rbw1_7F7QZjW2m06pS2GJWX1W8xGwws295t4RN5vd1MW1GdPMW6JvkJq1367BrW5Cm6Vq1kGdtwW5j5R8Z4rnG1bW8gV5MF38XkcSW6FFfyw5JzjcxW75VjSN7SCW5wW6WR0698j1SFKf6vBVJg04?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener\">proponent</a>&nbsp;of scaling up models. A number of companies raised billions of dollars by generating buzz around the narrative that, with more capital, they could (i) scale up and (ii) predictably drive improvements. Consequently, there has been a huge focus on scaling up, as opposed to a more nuanced view that gives due attention to the many different ways we can make progress. Driven in part by the U.S. AI chip embargo, the DeepSeek team had to innovate on many optimizations to run on less-capable H800 GPUs rather than H100s, leading ultimately to a model trained (omitting research costs) for under $6M of compute.</p><p>It remains to be seen if this will actually reduce demand for compute. Sometimes making each unit of a good cheaper can result in more dollars in total going to buy that good. I think the demand for intelligence and compute has practically no ceiling over the long term, so I remain bullish that humanity will use more intelligence even as it gets cheaper.</p><p>I saw many different interpretations of DeepSeek’s progress on social media, as if it was a Rorschach test that allowed many people to project their own meaning onto it. I think DeepSeek-R1 has geopolitical implications that are yet to be worked out. And it’s also great for AI application builders. My team has already been brainstorming ideas that are newly possible only because we have easy access to an open advanced reasoning model. This continues to be a great time to build!</p><p>Keep learning,</p><p>Andrew</p><hr><h2 id=\"a-message-from-deeplearningai\">A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;DEEPLEARNING.AI</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-towards-computer-use-with-anthropic/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--5--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Promo banner for &quot;Building Towards Computer Use with Anthropic&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"945\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--5--1.png 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--5--1.png 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--5--1.png 1600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/The-Batch-ads-and-exclusive-banners--5--1.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>Discover Anthropic’s new capabilty - Computer Use - that allows LLM-based agents use a computer interface.

Unlike supervised and unsupervised learning, which compare the model's output to a known ground truth, RL doesn’t explicitly tell a model what it should output. Instead, the model starts out behaving randomly and discovers desired behaviors by earning rewards for its actions. This makes RL especially popular for training machine learning models that play games or control robots.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;To improve the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9blkmNCmkSgQZlF3w69mEVR39Kcgh5igqFqSYQXxJbJImIrQOL0IJdK2usUU4q7nNePZXv\" rel=\"noopener\">chain of thought</a>&nbsp;(CoT) generated by a large language model (LLM), reinforcement learning encourages the model to generate correct solutions to math, coding, science, and other problems that have known solutions. Unlike typical LLM training, in which the model simply generates the next token of its output and receives feedback token by token, this method rewards the model for generating a sequence of reasoning steps that lead to an accurate conclusion, even if doing so requires generating many intermediate tokens between the prompt and the response — to plan an outline, check the conclusion, or reflect on the approach — without explicit training on the reasoning steps to take.</p><ul><li>The DeepSeek team found that fine-tuning via reinforcement learning alone (after pretraining) was sufficient for DeepSeek-R1-Zero to learn problem-solving strategies like double checking its answer. However, the model also showed quirky behaviors such as mixing different languages in its output. The team overcame these issues in DeepSeek-R1 by supervised fine-tuning on a small number of long CoT examples prior to reinforcement learning.</li><li>Similarly, the Kimi k1.5 team found that fine-tuning the model on long CoTs prior to reinforcement learning enabled it to devise its own problem-solving strategies.

But synthetic training data, even if it represents the training task well, may include characteristics like toxicity that impart unwelcome properties in the trained model’s output, and it may inconsistently represent desired traits such as the target output length. Researchers developed a method that reduces aspects of generated data and retains desired ones.</p><p><strong>What’s new:</strong>&nbsp;Luísa Shimabucoro and colleagues at Cohere introduced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.521/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">active inheritance</a>, a fine-tuning method that automatically selects synthetic training examples that have desirable characteristics.</p><p><strong>Key insight:</strong>&nbsp;A naive way to generate synthetic fine-tuning data is to feed prompts to a model, collect its output, and use that as the fine-tuning set.

After fine-tuning on the lowest-toxicity responses generated by Llama 2 7B, Mixtral 8x7B’s expected maximum toxicity fell to 43.2. Conversely, after fine-tuning on random responses generated by Llama 2 7B, its expected maximum toxicity rose to 70.3.</li><li>It also helped Llama 2 7B to cut its toxicity. Before fine-tuning, the model’s expected maximum toxicity was 71.7. After fine-tuning on its own least-toxic responses, expected maximum toxicity dropped to 50.7. Fine-tuning on random responses made its expected maximum toxicity fall less sharply to 68.1.</li><li>Examining the impact of the authors’ method on more typical measures of performance, fine-tuning on the least-toxic responses and fine-tuning on random responses had about the same effect across seven benchmarks. Fine-tuning Llama 2 7B on its own least-toxic responses increased performance on average from 59.97 percent accuracy to 60.22 percent accuracy, while fine-tuning on random responses increased performance on average from 59.97 percent accuracy to 61.05 percent accuracy.</li><li>However, the process degraded performance in some cases. Fine-tuning Mixtral-8x7B on the least-toxic Llama 2 7B responses decreased its average performance across seven benchmarks for question answering and common-sense reasoning from 70.24 percent accuracy to 67.48 percent accuracy. Fine-tuning it on random Llama 2 7B responses cut its average performance from 70.24 percent accuracy to 65.64 percent accuracy.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Training on synthetic data is becoming increasingly common. While it shows great promise, best practices for data generation are still being formulated. The authors’ method helps by automatically steering models toward generating more desirable responses, reducing negative traits and reinforcing positive traits.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Knowledge distillation lately has led to more capable and compact models. This approach adds levers of fine control to that technique.</p>",

Each MoE layer contains a group of neural networks, or experts, preceded by a gating module that learns to choose which one(s) to use based on the input. In this way, different experts learn to specialize in different types of examples. Because not all parameters are used to produce any given output, the network uses less energy and runs faster than models of similar size that use all parameters to process every input.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong>&nbsp;DeepSeek-R1 is a version of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/deepseek-v3-redefines-llm-performance-and-cost-efficiency/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_XYFWn01lgRHOHHoG29MCoeHJMwAlwmdpxqttrde0200WS63g8MBJynbh49LJyK8A4ERgq\" rel=\"noopener\">DeepSeek-V3-Base</a>&nbsp;that was fine-tuned over four stages to enhance its ability to process a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_XYFWn01lgRHOHHoG29MCoeHJMwAlwmdpxqttrde0200WS63g8MBJynbh49LJyK8A4ERgq\" rel=\"noopener\">chain of thought</a>&nbsp;(CoT).

(In comparison, o1 costs $15 per million input tokens, $7.50 for cached inputs, and $60 per million output tokens.)</p><ul><li>The team members fine-tuned DeepSeek-V3-Base on a synthetic dataset of thousands of long-form CoT examples that were generated using multiple techniques. For instance, they prompted DeepSeek-V3-Base few-shot style with long CoTs as examples, prompted that model to generate detailed answers while evaluating and double-checking its own CoT steps,&nbsp; and hired human annotators to refine and process the results.</li><li>They used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_XYFWn01lgRHOHHoG29MCoeHJMwAlwmdpxqttrde0200WS63g8MBJynbh49LJyK8A4ERgq\">group relative policy optimization</a>, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to improve the model’s ability to solve challenging problems. For example, for math problems, they created rule-based systems that rewarded the model for returning the final answer in a particular format (an accuracy reward) and for showing its internal CoT steps within &lt;think&gt; tags (a format reward).</li><li>For further fine-tuning, they used the in-progress versions of R1 to generate around 600,000 responses to reasoning prompts, retaining only correct responses. They mixed in another 200,000 non-reasoning examples (such as language translation pairs) either generated by DeepSeek-V3-base or from its training dataset.</li><li>They fine-tuned the model using a final round of reinforcement learning. This step encouraged the model to further boost its accuracy on reasoning problems while generally improving its helpfulness and harmlessness.</li></ul><p><strong>Other models:</strong>&nbsp;DeepSeek researchers also released seven related models.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Zero?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_XYFWn01lgRHOHHoG29MCoeHJMwAlwmdpxqttrde0200WS63g8MBJynbh49LJyK8A4ERgq\" rel=\"noopener\">DeepSeek-R1-Zero</a>&nbsp;is similar to DeepSeek-R1, but fine-tuned entirely using reinforcement learning. The researchers note that DeepSeek-R1-Zero was able to develop problem-solving strategies simply by being given incentives to do so. However, it was more likely to mix languages and produce unreadable outputs.</li><li>DeepSeek also released six dense models (with parameter counts of 1.5 billion, 7 billion, 8 billion, 14 billion, 32 billion, and 70 billion), four of them based on versions of Qwen, and two based on versions of Llama.</li></ul><p><strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;In DeepSeek’s tests, DeepSeek-R1 went toe-to-toe with o1, outperforming that model on 5 of 11 of the benchmarks tested. Some of the other new models showed competitive performance, too.</p><ul><li>DeepSeek-R1 topped o1 on AIME 2024, MATH-500, and SWE-Bench Verified, while turning in competitive performance on Codeforces, GPQA Diamond, and MMLU. For instance, on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://livecodebench.github.io/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_XYFWn01lgRHOHHoG29MCoeHJMwAlwmdpxqttrde0200WS63g8MBJynbh49LJyK8A4ERgq\" rel=\"noopener\">LiveCodeBench</a>, which includes coding problems that are frequently updated, it solved 65.9 percent of problems correctly, while o1 solved 63.4 percent correctly.</li><li>It also outperformed two top models that don’t implement chains of thought without explicit prompting. It bested Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet on 19 of 21 benchmarks and OpenAI GPT-4o on 20 of 21 benchmarks.</li><li>In DeepSeek’s tests, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across all benchmarks tested including AIME 2024 and GPQA Diamond, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B beats o1-mini on all benchmarks tested except Codeforces.</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Late last year, OpenAI’s o1 kicked off a trend toward so-called reasoning models that implement a CoT without explicit prompting. But o1 and o3, its not-yet-widely-available successor, hide their reasoning steps. In contrast, DeepSeek-R1 bares all, allowing users to see the steps the model took to arrive at a particular answer. DeepSeek’s own experiments with distillation show how powerful such models can be as teachers to train smaller student models. Moreover, they appear to pass along some of the benefits of their reasoning skills, making their students more accurate.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:</strong>&nbsp;DeepSeek is rapidly emerging as a strong builder of open models. Not only are these models great performers, but their license permits use of their outputs for distillation, potentially pushing forward the state of the art for language models (and multimodal models) of all sizes.</p>",

AI Product Management has a bright future!</p><p>Software is often written by teams that comprise Product Managers (PMs), who decide what to build (such as what features to implement for what users) and Software Developers, who write the code to build the product. Economics shows that when two goods are complements — such as cars (with internal-combustion engines) and gasoline — falling prices in one leads to higher demand for the other. For example, as cars became cheaper, more people bought them, which led to increased demand for gas. Something similar will happen in software. Given a clear specification for what to build, AI is making the building itself much faster and cheaper. This will significantly increase demand for people who can come up with clear specs for valuable things to build.</p><p>This is why I’m excited about the future of Product Management, the discipline of developing and managing software products. I’m especially excited about the future of AI Product Management, the discipline of developing and managing AI software products.</p><p>Many companies have an Engineer:PM ratio of, say, 6:1. (The ratio varies widely by company and industry, and anywhere from 4:1 to 10:1 is typical.) As coding becomes more efficient, I think teams will need more product management work (as well as design work) as a fraction of the total workforce. Perhaps engineers will step in to do some of this work, but if it remains the purview of specialized Product Managers, then the demand for these roles will grow.</p><p>This change in the composition of software development teams is not yet moving forward at full speed. One major force slowing this shift, particularly in AI Product Management, is that Software Engineers, being technical, are understanding and embracing AI much faster than Product Managers. Even today, most companies have difficulty finding people who know how to develop products and also understand AI, and I expect this shortage to grow.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/AIProductManager-2_1200px-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Two colleagues discuss their chatbot’s success; one suggests hiring an AI Product Manager.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/AIProductManager-2_1200px-1.jpg 600w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/AIProductManager-2_1200px-1.jpg 1000w, https://dl-staging-website.ghost.io/content/images/2025/01/AIProductManager-2_1200px-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Further, AI Product Management requires a different set of skills than traditional software Product Management. It requires:</p><ul><li><strong>Technical proficiency in AI.</strong>&nbsp;PMs need to understand what products might be technically feasible to build. They also need to understand the lifecycle of AI projects, such as data collection, building, then monitoring, and maintenance of AI models.</li><li><strong>Iterative development.</strong>&nbsp;Because AI development is much more iterative than traditional software and requires more course corrections along the way, PMs need to understand how to manage such a process.</li><li><strong>Data proficiency.</strong>&nbsp;AI products often learn from data, and they can be designed to generate richer forms of data than traditional software.</li><li><strong>Skill in managing ambiguity.</strong>&nbsp;Because AI’s performance is hard to predict in advance, PMs need to be comfortable with this and have tactics to manage it.</li><li><strong>Ongoing learning.</strong>&nbsp;AI technology is advancing rapidly. PMs, like everyone else who aims to make best use of the technology, need to keep up with the latest technology advances, product ideas, and how they fit into users’ lives.</li></ul><p>Finally, AI Product Managers will need to know how to ensure that AI is implemented responsibly (for example, when we need to implement guardrails to prevent bad outcomes), and also be skilled at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-to-get-user-feedback-to-your-ai-products-fast/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8E3vaHtVCWyWM5X79V_-x7uED1QR5exdS62WzX7rqOxTAyyDUu5M6mivzzbnP3hw8qJKhG\" rel=\"noopener\">gathering feedback fast</a>&nbsp;to keep projects moving.

Cosmos includes pretrained language and vision models that range from 4 billion to 14 billion parameters for generating synthetic training data for robots or building policy models that translate a robot’s state into its next action.

Like CLIP, X-CLR takes advantage of both images and their captions for self-supervised learning. However, CLIP learns to recognize image-text pairs as similar or dissimilar, while X-CLR matches image-image pairs using captions as a similarity signal that’s continuous rather than discrete.</p><p><strong>We’re thinking:&nbsp;</strong>Reality is not black and white.
